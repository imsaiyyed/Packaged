Generally; it just lacked imagination.	2
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	2
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.	2

I love my kindle thanks honey	1
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).	1
come hungry i made arrangements for a family dinner for my husbands birthday here last night weve been wanting to try it for the longest time and between the churrascarias that ive been to in shanghai brazil and ca this may very well be one of my tops the side bar actually has interesting items from your typical salad bar aside from the meat with side bar option you can just go for the side bar where the only meats available with that option is prosciutto salami anchovies and smoked trout we also ordered the tres leches cake which was just right the service food atmosphere are all solid to me and id recommend it to any meat lover looking to kill it ayce style	1
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.	2
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.	1
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1
you say brister could make the all decade team throwing to rice and young  couldn't?  that is not saying much for your boy.  he is better than brister,  just not elway.	0
ohhh sooo good i literally went here everyday for an entire week when i first found out about it the philly cheese steaks are amazing dont bother getting it with mushrooms because you end up paying extra money for like 5 slices of mushroom also make sure you get it with cheez whiz yeah i know i was wary of it too but i decided to give it a go and wow it makes a difference they also offer american and provolone but neither of them stand a chance against the whiz they also have a little pepper bar with different kinds of peppers i usually get the big jalapeno slices but dont add too many theyre arent spicy at all but it takes away from the flavor of the meatcheesebread if you want spice i recommend some sriracha sauce on that steak it adds the perfect kick just know that i am extremely biased towards sriracha sauce haha ive also had the crispy chicken sandwich which was equally as good as the cheese steak for days when you feel like something different its like a high quality version of the tendercrisp at bk dont let that description steer you away cuz it really is good it comes on hoagie bread with a huge slab of freshly fried chicken mayo lettuce tomatos and onions also do not i repeat do not forget to get some garlic fries they are so good for only 2 you get an entire box full 50 extra for ranch which i say is a must have with garlic fries this place is also one of the very few places in berkeley that actually takes discover yay they also take amex for those of you who like to use that make sure you dont around lunch time cuz it is packed you cant move an inch without bumping into at least 6 people ive found that the best time is to go around 2 or 3pm when its completely empty	1
Never again will I be dining at this place!	2

The California AG and PUC have petitioned FERC to vacate its order approving PG&E's recent reorganization. Obviously by this reorganization, PG&E is attempting to shield its assets in the event of a bankruptcy. I'm wondering if we should become active in this case, to protect our interests in the event of a bankruptcy.	0

Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, Gake No Ue No Ponyo (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.	1
i forgot to call them yesterday.  i will try tonight.  i leave sat for n.o.  for the cruise.  i will be back the following sunday.	0
Best thing since sliced bread.	1
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.	2
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.	1
While my kids watch Dora, I am indulging my Kindle fetish. I just LOVE my Kindle. My little girls love to help me, turn the page, while reading. Cant wait to try out some kids books, too.	1

Please find below the first glimpse of the plan to update, and review, the  largest 50 curves; they represent 75% of URM exposure. I am confident of  your cooperation and support; both are absolutely essential to complete this  ambitious schedule on time (the process will start on April 23rd and  conclude by May 25th, 2001).  Stella, Pat and I are currently working on streamlining the regulatory inputs  required from you in a faster, and more cost-effective manner. We are also  working on ensuring that documentation will be compiled in a very user  friendly database (with the help/support of Elizabeth it shall be on the  intranet) that will make the process next time a cinch, and provide the  required inputs for your suggested strategy for the curve/utility when the  time comes (it is the second stage of the process).   Stella, Pat and I shall seek your permission for an appropriate time this  coming week to discuss the details of the plan and take stock of your  comments and suggestions.	0
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	2
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!	1
You'll love it!   1 This movie is BAD.   0 So bad.   0 The film is way too long.   0 This is definitely one of the bad ones.   0 The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.   1 John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.   1 His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.   1 I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.   1 I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.   0 I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.   0 It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.   0 Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.   0 Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.   1 His performance is simply genius.   1 He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.	1
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an Are you being helped?	2
No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.	2
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.	1

He was terrible!	2
The individual RTOs have the upper hand as far as dictating what the  scheduling practices will be. This is driven by the fact that the RTO  efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders. The  problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to  define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have  taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices. In  the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3  RTOs (there are some in theEast as well).	0

This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	1
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.	2
I agree with Dan. Have we sold above the cap? If so, report. If not, tell them we will let them know when we do.	0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.	2
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.	2
Rose, I downloaded Every Word onto my Kindle. It was free then, about 6 months ago. It is a fun wordgame, if you like word games. It gives you 6-7 letters per level and you try to make as many words as you can. They place the words that you have come up with in alphabetical order so you can see what you might be missing.  I like it.	1
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
great...no problems at all!.	1
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.	2
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.	2

Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.	1
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.	1

I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.	1
Do you think that it makes sense for the four of us to sit down with this  report the day after it comes out and discuss (1) Enron's perspective, (2)  should/are we participating, and (3) key commercial / regulatory that need  the information?  I am trying to make sure that everything is covered appropriately and maybe  this is the right format - unless you guys can think of something else?	0

As we previously reported, on March 14, 2001, FERC announced certain actions  to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in  an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas  Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further  Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption. The  following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately  help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory  incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure. The  Commission also invited comments on certain proposals. This memo includes a  list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.	0

I may be behind in the e-mail discussions - I have not downloaded remote in the last 2 days so this issue may be resolved by now. Also I may not fully understand the concern as e-mails are imperfect. However, I'm not sure the customer wait for FERC order option helps with an orderly process for interconnections. Suppose the non-signing customer is first in the queue. Suppose the second in queue customer is happy with the FIOA, signs and wants construction to start. If the second customer facilities depends on building facilities for the first customer we have an impasse, a mess. We need to find a way for the first customer to resolve legitimate problems with a FIOA and not hold up other interconnection customers. How can we do this?	0
$50.  not much for a shooter like me.  i will probably win it tonight at  liars poker.	0
An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.	1
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.	2
otras baterias tambien son otra buena opcion para comprar puesto que si usan mucho el screen para revisar las fotografias se consumen bastante rapido	2
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.	1
if you are going to the one in the village i think you should try another  place.  there is this place called chipotle on kirby two blocks down from  bissonet.  it is the best.  they are out of denver.  it is much better than  texadelphia.	0

Attached is EPMI's 3rd quarter WSPP report for your review and comments, Wright & Talisman request that we submit our filing electronically by Friday, October 27.	0
The revised response is attached. I talked with Joe Eisenberg and told him we'd like the Amend. 22 proceeding  included. He said this primary objective is to have everything proceed in  one forum. However, he is concerned about giving people an opening to tack  on additional matters. I said that at a minimum we wanted clarity whether  anything other than the 3 Charge-Back matters were covered by the motion. He  said there was no problem clarifying if his client wouldn't agree to include  the Amend. 22 matter. As many of you know the PX sued the ISO regarding funds paid by PG&E to the  ISO that should have gone to the PX. I asked Joe why the creditors weren't  generally informed this was in the works, and why they filed in district  court if he's trying to channel all proceedings. He said he wasn't really  aware the action was filed (it was filed by another firm). He had sought  retention of that firm but he thought it was going to be handled throught the  administrative process. It seems like there needs to be more focus at the  PX, especially since they're spending the participants money.	0

The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.	2
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.	1
But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.	1

Hello, Everyone - This Notice confirms our meeting for this coming Friday, March 23, 2001, from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel. Because there are fewer items on the agenda, this RRG meeting should be shorter than usual, and we hope to wrap up by 11:00 a.m. The purpose of the meeting is primarily to discuss with the RRG a phased approach to implementing congestion management. The filing utilities are very aware of the concerns many parties have expressed about process overload, and the burden this imposes on you. Consequently, the filing utilities are considering a more focused process that will call for prioritizing the work streams over the next few weeks. Part of this more focused process is a proposal for a potential phasing of congestion management implementation.	0

There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.	2
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.	1
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.	2
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.	2
I really enjoyed eating here.	1
Very little music or anything to speak of.	2
She carries the movie well.	1
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, you see kids... Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.	2

This Notice confirms our meeting for this coming Friday, March 23, 2001, from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel. Because there are fewer items on the agenda, this RRG meeting should be shorter than usual, and we hope to wrap up by 11:00 a.m. The purpose of the meeting is primarily to discuss with the RRG a phased approach to implementing congestion management. The filing utilities are very aware of the concerns many parties have expressed about process overload, and the burden this imposes on you. Consequently, the filing utilities are considering a more focused process that will call for prioritizing the work streams over the next few weeks. Part of this more focused process is a proposal for a potential phasing of congestion management implementation. A background paper for your review before the meeting is attached.	0
One of my favorite purchases ever.	1
Even the squibs look awful.	2
Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be. As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power. Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT. Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week.	0
Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.	1

i love this place it is not pretentious but the food is always solid the lobster risotto is wonderful and the service is great ive eaten here 5 times and havent been disappointed yet	1
It is worth the drive.	1
Just don't know why they were so slow.	2
The real disappointment was our waiter.	2
I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem. I was wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get Steve Wright to sign on given that this situation must make it more difficult for him to balance his budget.	0
Think of the film being like a dream.	1
This is an extraordinary film.	1
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.	1
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	1
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.	1
when you want some good chinese food this place is awesome well the place is called vietnam village but it basically serves what i know as chinese food haha the owner is super nice the service is fast the food is cheap because the portions are huge its like 3 servings perserving thats awesome	1
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).	1
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.	1
the food is not tasty at all, not to say its real traditional Hunan style.	2
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.	1
i think so.  one of the guys seems to know her.	0
Awful.	2
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	2
Love my kindle too & have the free kindle app on iPhone. Just have to sync whichever you go on & it updates to where you left off.	1
Today, I worked with Robin Gibbs and Jeff Alexander on an Enron pleading in the captioned case. I asked if we had considered asking FERC Staff to file a friend of the court brief detailing how FERC has occupied the field of wholesale rate regulation. Was this or should this be considered?	0

I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.	2
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.	2
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	2
Perfect for the PS3.	1
I liked it.	1
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	1
My kindle was a late Christmas gift to myself. I truly believe is the greatest invention since peanut butter. Not overly complicated or overly pretentious. Sexy in its simplicity, elegant in its usefulness. I love my kindle	1

The available transmision capacity (ATC) derate did occur and has occured everydaysince about the 24th. This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday. Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this information is verifiable with the ISO. Our customer contact didn't know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged. The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency. The line was again rated at zero today. I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved. I've talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston. Eric believes he can get the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade press. So check the trade press tomorrow.	0
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.	2

this is what ive been missing no one told me how great toast is wtf ha saturday night with a couple yelpies we stopped in here around 1030ish for a small bite and some wine small bite turned into a cheese plate and the shrimp and grits i keep thinking about that shrimp and grits dish fantastic i always picture sloppy breakfast looking grits is this picture off base yes i also enjoyed how the wine is served with choice of the pourgives room to sample i tried the chianti and it made me warm right up on a chilly night last but not least the chocolate dessert just magnificent the waiter told our table that peeps come in just for that choc dessert its that good ill be back	1

straight up the best burgers around boston no problems there they are huge malformed and juicy theres a thousand options for toppings and the fries will stick directly to your aorta its heaven on a bun capped with heartdestroying cheddar and mushrooms the thing that makes bartleys awesome in my mind though aside from just how good the burgers are is that eating there is an experience whether theyve always done business the way they have or whether it was set up to be sort of tourist trapy i dont know but its sweet the place is always supercrowded so youll be waiting in line on massachusetts avenue for a good 2030 minutes and a cranky old man will give you menus and pester you for your order at least 15 times before you get to the door when you finally do get in the staff will throw you at whatever open spot theyve got and since most of the place is set up in long trestle tables expect to be rubbing elbows with another group of people youve never met if you are an outrageous extrovert this is a good time to make friends if not this is a good time to start a passiveaggressive war with the elbows of the person next to you to truly enjoy bartleys it helps to go in with the right mindset if you like to enjoy leisurely meals with cocktails this is not the place for you if you want exotic cuisine or something other than a burger which they do have but seriously whats the point this is not the place for you if you want a burger and then maybe a milkshake after it and you want your face to melt when you eat it then bartleys is going to rock your burgerneeding pants off side note if you are coming in the winter the line is not necessarily any shorter than the other months of the year make sure you have a good coat	1

I think these are okay. Again, my reasoning is not based on a ctrprty-by-ctrprty check, but rather because I researched the code and criteria with the programmer and have been satisfied that the reports are performing as they should. Part of the alarm on Q2 numbers was caused by us not knowing which deals were included under the WSPP contract and trying to tie out with a different data pull. The only questions that remain for me are: how is the decision made to include deals under the contract number? How does that decision process get passed on to people as employees change? What is automated about it? My questions should not imply that I think the process is awry - I simply don't have enough of an understanding of the process to adequately answer those questions.	0

Can you and Sean Crandall call me about this? There have been a variety of problems with the full use of the sink provision based on FERC's Entergy order. Also, ComEd and TVA have precluded us from sinking at the generation only control area and FERC hotline has said this can be done without a FERC filing (or at least we would have to pursue it in a complaint--we don't want that result in a FERC order.) In addition, while you were on vacation, Nevada Power had the problem with Salt River Project. I don't know the status of that.

This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit very broad  authority to request information, specifically: the submission of any  infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be  potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose  activies may affect the operation of the ISO market.   Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap. The FERC did not order  us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now requesting it.  I think our only available approach is to provide the information to the ISO  pursuant to a confidentiality agreement. I have asked Sue Mara if she would  contact WPTF about negotiating a confidentiality agreement. Richard, please  advise if this is the proper course of action. Please note, the information  is due tomorrow.	0

I want to see who will be able to golf on Friday and Saturday. Friday we will golf here in San Antonio and everything is taken care of already. It will be at the Quarry and I think the times are between 8 adn 8:30 am. Saturday we will golf at the Shreiner Public Golf Course and we have a tee time at 8am and 8:07am. Fee for this this one I believe is $33.00/person.	0
Works well.	1
as you can tell by my previous reviews im pretty much a prick and dont give a place 5 stars unless it is remarkable in some respect anyway i cant say enough about how good my experience at abigails was to start the staff are outstanding they made you feel right at home from instant you walk in the hostess the server the bartender and even the owner sarah who seemed to greet every costumer made you feel very welcomedand the place was packed the music is top notch the staff bring in their own vinyl and the choices are perfect i like hall and oats and ian durry a lot the food aps guoda fries with bacon dangerously fucking rad oysters outstanding and huge entres the way i judge a restaurant is by how well their steak tastes medium rare the grass feed rib eye really got me going it was massive delicious and cooked perfectly the drinks wow the bartender knows what t he is doing well done oh and ps to nancy p there is obviously a reason why you were sitting alone	1

This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.	1
Love my kindle too!	1
apparently canon realized theres a problem with the eos 350ds focus system because the new eos 400d rebel xti comes with a different sensor its the same highly accurate ninepoint diamond shaped focus sensor thats found on the considerably more expensive professional grade eos 30d	2
dont even think about going for the canon rebel xt because the nikon d50 is cheaper and is the best camera you can get for the money on the market	1

To West Desk Traders in Cali: On Thursday 3/22, FERC will accept comments on its staff's plan to provide  market mitigation to California ISO markets. A summary of the report is  copied below. Enron GA plans to file a motion that will support the comments of EPSA and  WPTF and supplement the comments as noted below.  EPSA's comments are generally supportive of the staff report but recommends  that FERC: clarify that staff's market mitigation measures are being put into place to  address structural defects in the California market, not the abuse of market  power by any market participants;  avoid the use of cost-based rates as a proxy for competitive prices during  times of scarcity; ensure that if cost-based proxy rates are used, those rates includes the full  value of scarcity, capacity, opportunity costs, and other factors; develop proxy rates, if necessary, using the formula in the March 9th Refund  Order RATHER THAN the unit specific marginal costs identified in the order;  and forego forced bidding into real-time markets.  WPTF will make similar comments (generally with more color and vehemence) and  will also raise how lack of creditworthiness will affect price. I also recommend we supplement the EPSA/WPTF comments with some additional  comments on energy-limited resources, see attached.	0
I attach notes from our conference call today. Sarah, feel free to put these  notes on the web site.	0
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
Thanks for the draft. We are informed that the PX has filed in Chapter 11.  It may argue that FERC's proceedings fall within the automatic stay, and that  even if they don't, the accounting we are proposing inappropriately overlaps  the role of the bankruptcy court.	0

Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.	1
What this film lacks is a convincing script.	2
It was also the right balance of war and love.	1
After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.	1
I would have loved to have had my kindle while nursing and rocking sick babies! I LOVE my Kindle and tell everyone about them!	1
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	2
i love this place way better than felipesannas the summer and mediterranean burritos are amazing whoever invented mango salsa is a god	1
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.	2
Excellent product!  I dont worry about tossing my Kindle into my bag with the Timbuk2 Envelope Sleeve.	1
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.	2
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).	1
Avoid, avoid, avoid!	2
I just saw this film and I recommend it.	1
BAsed on the conference call we just completed, Ben Zycher will be preparing  a revised version of his draft paper which will be circulated later today. You should return any comments, in a redlined format, directly to Ben, as he  will maintain document control of his paper. Comments will be appreciated as  soon as possible, but no later than close of business tomorrow. Meanwhile, I will be significantly redoing the draft filing sent out  yesterday. It will highlight Ben's findings and attach his paper to our  filing, which will focus on policy and operational issues raised by the FERC  staff proposal. It will go out later tonight and, as with Ben's paper,  comments will be required no later than close of business Wednesday. In connection with that, I have redceived the draft Williams comments. Any  other WPTF member who is planning to file should also send me as soon as  possible the latest version of your proposed comments, so that I can avoid  any inconsistent staments in the WPTF filing and support some of the  positions you are taking. Thanks!	0
I would highly recommend this product.	1
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.	1

yet again another 5 star review for this place but well deserved i finally got to experience the amazingness that is gracies last night and boy was it unforgettable first of all the ambiance alone gives this place 5 stars stars everywhere dim lighting comfy benches with pillows attentive staff etcso great my boyfriend and i split a bottle of wine which the server helped us pick out fantastic choice by her and we loved it the fresh bread was also great i loved the classic french baguette and with the homemade butter i could have filled up on it alone we then decided to go with the prix fixe menu that begins at 40 some special dishes have a slight upcharge but well worth it i started with the gnocchi and he had the poached egg the gnocchi was the best i have ever had no lie it melted in my mouth with bursts of flavor incredible for entree i chose chicken ballotine and he had duck both dishes were completely out of this world with impeccable presentation we both completely devoured our plates not a drop was left dessert time i had the creme brulee and he had the cheese platter again perfection and devoured in its entirety we will absolutely positively 100 be returning to gracies without a doubt next time we are going to try the 7course wine pairing dinner i know it will be well worth the steep 90 price	1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.	1
i have gone multiple times and my parents pretty much live here the staff is very helpful and knowledgeable on what they have and they are super friendly i love trying new things and i am never disappointed my dad has helped them with a batch of beer they have made reeses vodka just for my mom and honestly whenever i go with them to eat its like i walk onto the set of cheers everybody knows their name but you dont have to be a regular to feel like youre getting special treatment i love that they bring you samples of their beer or tell you what just became available after aging i love the location i love the feel i just wish i had more money so i could visit them more often	1

Recent occurrences of missing PMI Information and observations regarding today's 10 minute price data: * We experienced difficulty with BEEP last evening (3/6/01) with interval 6 of HE24. The Ex-post Market Information for HE24 and the 10 minute price data for Hour 24 interval 6 is not presently available on either the OASIS or SI/PMI sites. * On Monday (3/5/01), We experienced system difficulty with the SI system which prohibited us from completing the Hour 18 automated real-time processes. Therefore, ex-post data for Intervals 1-3 in the Ex-post 10 minute price information and Ex-post market information for Hour 18 is also not currently available. We expect to publish this missing data later today, and barring any unforeseen delays, will provide notification upon completion of the re-publication of the missing data. * Also, we have observed in the 10 minute price data for TODAY for Hour 06:00 Intervals 1 and 2 a negative INC/DEC price (-5.17) is present. We have verified that this information does reflect the actual dispatches and is correct.	0

Enron Campers  are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end  of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check  out.  It's that easy!	0
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.	2

Democratic Caucus announced a package of bills to increase the supply of electricity and cut down on demand through energy efficiency. The package being introduced will produce more than 750 megawatts and save 1,200 megawatts over the next few years. Said the energy efficiency package may save as many as 500 megawatts, equivalent to a new power plant. Demos presented a four bill package aimed at rapidly increasing and stabilizing the supply of power available to the demands of residents and businesses.	0

The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion:  1. Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay;  including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of  motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's  motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing  date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding;  2. Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of  collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay.  3. Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all  collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing  and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs.  In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds  the total of the foregoing matters?  4. Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer to  PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 22 proceeding; including the  timing of such filings with FERC.  This email does not address bankruptcy counsel for all parties. If you wish  to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of  the time and relevant information for the call. This call will likely be extremely unwieldy, so I would request the parties  to consolidate their participants where possible. Also, please do not  forward this information as it addresses confidential litigation matters.	0

Based on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons: Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was not artfully written. Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information necessary for refunds. We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more liquid. As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals will not be achieved. Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell out-of-market without FERC scrutiny.	0

Regarding the March 21st meeting -- I appreciate all of your responses regarding the rescheduling request.

As such, we'll go ahead with the meeting as original scheduled on the 21st. My apologies to those of you who will not be able to attend.	0

Bill Howard from FERC just called me. The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today: How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price? I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants. He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential. He said he didn't know.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- PG&E Corp. disclosed Friday that it has received a $1.2  billion tax refund and will hand over almost all the money to its nearly  bankrupt utility. The San Francisco-based company said it will give $1.1 billion to Pacific Gas  and Electric Co., the utility whose losses last year triggered the refund. By  turning over the refund to its subsidiary, PG&E is following the suggestion  of a state-ordered audit released in January The holding company hasn't always been so generous with its utility. PG&E  pocketed a $278 million overpayment that the utility made on its 1999 taxes,  according to the audit by the Barrington-Wellesley Group Inc. With the refund, Pacific Gas and Electric's cash reserves rose to $2.7  billion, but the utility still doesn't have enough money to pay hundreds of  increasingly testy creditors. The utility has been on the financial ropes for months because wholesale  electricity prices have been far higher than retail prices since last May. As  of Jan. 31, Pacific Gas and Electric said it had run up an $8.3 billion debt  buying electricity. Pacific Gas and Electric plans to use some of the tax refund to maintain the  operations that enable the utility to continue delivering power to its  customers.	0

See attached pleading we are drafting. The PX is seeking permission from the  Bankruptcy Court to lift the stay to allow parties to continue this FERC case.	0
I was asked to set up a conference call for Monday (3/19) at 3:00 Eastern with regulatory and bankruptcy counsel for the nine Complainants to discuss the interrelation between the FERC Chargeback complaint proceeding (and the Amendment 22 matter), the District Court case before Judge Moreno, and the Bankruptcy proceeding, and to discuss strategy. Dial-in #: 1-800-403-2008 Participants #: 143570 The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion:  1. Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay; including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding;  2. Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay.  3. Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs. In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds the total of the foregoing matters?  4. Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer to PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 22 proceeding; including the timing of such filings with FERC.  This email does not address bankruptcy counsel for all parties. If you wish to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of the time and relevant information for the call. This call will likely be extremely unwieldy, so I would request the parties to consolidate their participants where possible. Also, please do not forward this information as it addresses confidential litigation matters.	0

On February 28, 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a request for  information regarding the outcome to date of the different regulatory and  legislative approaches states have taken to the introduction of retail  electric competition. The FTC is examining various state retail competition  programs to determine which features have resulted in consumer benefits, and  which have not. EPSA's comments do not answer every question in the  Commission's notice, but instead take a broad view of competitive markets to  date. A draft copy of EPSA's comments is attached for your review. Comments are due at the FTC on April 3rd. We will discuss the attached draft  during our West region conference call on Monday, April 2nd at 2:00 p.m.  (EDT). To access this call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the  EPSA/Samantha Slater call. Please forward all comments to Samantha Slater  (sslater@epsa.org or 202-628-8200) no later than the close of business on  Friday, March 30th. If you have any questions, comments or concerns about  the draft and cannot participate on the conference call, please contact  Samantha Slater before Monday's conference call.	0

In an effort to control costs for travel expenses, as Jeff Skilling suggested  in his floor meeting last week, Rick would like for everyone to purchase  tickets from the Travel Agency in the Park (TAP), which is the preferred  travel agent for Enron. The savings that Enron receives from using TAP is  insurmountable. See below, a list of the contracts Enron has negotiated with  some of the airlines. Whenever possible, plan to purchase tickets at least  3-7 days in advance. Often the pre-purchase savings outweighs the potential  switching fee. The travel agency is also able to give you a better price for  hotel reservations through the Hickory rate, which is cheaper then the  corporate rate. TAP's phone number is 713-650-8080 (web address:  http://www.travelpark.com)	0

I think risk can be pretty easily explained as similar to getting a credit card when you have shakey credit.? You can do it, but you're going to pay a helluva high interest rate. The ISO has shakey credit and has to pay a higher price because the sellers (credit card issuers) build in a risk premium.? I think even reporters could understand this.	0

i walked out of park the other night in stunned silence and suffering the most intense food and beer coma i have ever experienced i had a meal fit for a king or some kind of nobility walked into park having heard good things but nothing specific so had zero expectations it was a saturday night and the floor was full so to the bar we went i honestly think sitting at the bar made the experience all the better to start the service was incredible every single bartender stopped by to see how we were and to joke around there was a great sense of camaraderie between not only the bartenders but the guests as well the dcor was incredibly cozy and complimented the elevated farmhouse vibe of the menu the food and beer was everything ive ever wanted and everything i have ever needed i guess you can call me a beer newb but my eyes were opened by their awesome selection of beers on tap my friend was in charge of ordering beer and apps she did an amazing job of exploring the beer list but her choice of app was the only meh moment of the meal she ordered the chicken wings which dont get me wrong were good however compared to everything else they were just okay for my entree i obviously got the daily meat pie how could you put a meat pie in front of my face and expect me not to choose it that day it was braised chicken something with red wine sauce and mushrooms it was a huge portion and i did some serious damage to it i cant wait to go back and see how they change it up my friend got the bar steak which was really quite amazing overall the food was pretty close to perfect at least for my palate well done park	1

Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI  wants to submit an offer on. PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for  50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's  system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North. Offers are due by March 28 and PGE  has until April 5, 2001 to accept .  I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the  terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff. I have also told him that EPMI  could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory  risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's  favor. I would recommend the former. Ron - would you tell me how much you  would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review, in the event PGE accepts  our offer? Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing. Is that  okay?	0

The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets with a real supply curve and a real demand curve such that hourly clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity. With respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is necessary, that is subject to much debate. Although I prefer a zonal model for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.	0

four stars or five stars it was a close call pretty much i had an amazing first experience at benjys and it may very well be a new favorite of mine i think it is actually so i finally visited benjys after hearing so much about their happy hour from reviews and it being a yelp drinks destination visiting their happy hour was the best decision ever it was very cool the restaurant has a nice set up with the loungy bar upstairs and the patio i came for happy hour and was sure i would order some food off their appetizer menu i ended up trying the asian chicken salad and the blood orange margarita the margarita was good my memory is a little clouded of the specifics of that actually but i absolutely loved my salad my favorite food happens to be chinese chicken salad and ive been looking all over houston for a good salad the only place ive found thus far is cpk i love cpks salads anyways back to benjys the asian chicken salad was amazing the flavor of the chicken was a little smokey but perfect the salad had the right amount of crunchiness and the dressing was perfect the salad was big so big that i struggled eating the last few bites i was so full pretty much it was amazing but what was even better my server who im sure was a manager when taking my order he could tell that i wanted to try the calamari but he told me it was big so i decided not to order it because he said the salad was big too welp when he brought out my food he brought me a little bowl of calamari too so i could try it so the service gets five stars from me benjys i shall be back soon	1
I think its interesting that there are so many that assume people in developing countries go not read.

In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee. Par. 31,036 at 31,797. So in general, customers can't avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing. FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery. Id. at 31,810. There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass. For contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision. However, in that case, the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve. Id. at note 679. Accordingly, the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service.	0

David, it's my understanding from our call last week that we do not have a balance sheet or other accounting issue involved with these studies so long as we are not committing to any construction or other hard costs. I've reviewed the agreements and confirmed that the only commitment being made by Antelope Valley Energy Facility, LLC, our project company (AVEF) is to pay $50,000 as the cost of each study (which amount can't be increased unless AVEF agrees).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday  upheld a plan by utility PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG - news) to shield assets of its  unregulated subsidiaries from creditors, denying objections raised by  California state officials and by other companies.  The utility's plan, first approved by FERC last month, was widely seen as a  way to protect some PG&E subsidiaries if the parent company was driven to  bankruptcy by the California power crisis.  PG&E and Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news), California's two biggest  utilities, have been drained of billions of dollars by runaway wholesale  prices for electricity. Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, the  companies cannot pass through higher wholesale costs to consumers.  On Wednesday, FERC voted 2-to2 at a regularly scheduled meeting to deny  requests for a rehearing on PG&E's plan.  FERC said reorganization by PG&E -- which has annual revenues of more than  $20 billion -- would promote construction of new power generating plants in  the energy-starved state.  PG&E plans to create a limited-liability unit, NEG LLC, for its non-regulated  companies. Included in the new unit will be Athens Generating Co., Badger  Generating Co., Hermiston Generating Co., Lake Road Generating Co., La Poloma  Generating Co., Liberty Generating Co., Madison Windpower, Mantua Creek  Generating Co., PG&E Dispersed Generating Co., PG&E Energy Trading-Power,  Pittsfield Generating Co., and USGen New England Inc.  ``This reorganization would insert NEG in the ownership chain between PG&E  Corp and its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary NEG,'' FERC said in its order.  ``The stated purpose of this reorganization was to facilitate NEG's credit  rating and future financings, either by NEG or on behalf of the  subsidiaries.''  FERC rejected claims raised by California officials and companies that the  corporate reorganization plan would hurt competition.  ``There is only speculation that the transaction will increase the  possibility of non-payment by PG&E and deter non-affiliate suppliers from  selling power to PG&E, thus resulting in diminished power supplies in  California,'' the FERC order said.  The majority of commissioners said they believed the opposite to be true.  ``By improving the ability of the NEG companies to obtain higher credit  ratings, the reorganization may increase the likelihood that lenders will  finance PG&E's electric generation construction projects in California,'' the  order said.  FERC also said the utility's financial problems pre-date the corporate  reorganization.  Commissioner William Massey voted in favor of a rehearing but was overruled  by FERC chairman Curtis Hebert and Linda Breathitt. Massey previously  objected to PG&E's plan, expressing concern that such a corporate  reorganization might hurt ratepayers and competitors.  The NEG LLC's companies are not subject to the Federal Power Act.  California lawmakers have been trying to work out a detailed plan to provide  immediate and long-term relief to both utilities.  FERC is a five-member independent agency that regulates interstate  electricity, natural gas and hydropower issues. Two seats are currently  vacant.	0

I'm fine with this. The only other legal point you might make is that the  request for longer than 60 days is a collateral attack on the FERC's December  15 order, and an issue that (if memory serves) is already before the FERC on  rehearing.	0

Environmental regulations and policies have and will continue to play a  significant role in the current California energy crisis situation. It is  a high priority of the Enron Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)  organization to ensure that environmental issues are given serious  consideration as part of Enron's efforts to capitalize on opportunities and  manage risks related to the California crisis.  To that end, we have asked Mary Schoen, Manager, Environmental Strategies, to  serve as the EHS organization's key contact for commercial, government  affairs, EHS and public affairs personnel on environmental issues related to  the California crisis situation. As the primary interface with these  groups, Mary will coordinate the numerous resources of the entire EHS  department in support of Enron's activities, including:  Providing timely intelligence and analysis about environmental policy  developments that affect Enron markets; Reviewing legislation/regulation, coordinating environmental policy advocacy  strategies and providing input into overall Enron advocacy efforts; Providing assistance on environmental permitting, due diligence, and other  technical services.	0

In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.   1 Ray Charles is legendary.   1 Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.   1 Hitchcock is a great director.   1 Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.   0 Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.   1 It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.   0 Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.   0 The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.   0 There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.   0 Mishima is extremely uninteresting.   0 This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.   0 The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.   0 And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.   0 He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.   0 Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.   0 When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.   1 I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.   1 However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.   0 I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.   0 The character developments also lacked in depth.   0 Woa, talk about awful.   0 Do not waste your time.   0 It was just too horrible.   0 The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.   0 But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.   0 The poor actors.   0 You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.   0 If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.   0 This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.   0 If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.   1 The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.   1 Regrettably, the film fails.   0 The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.   0 No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.   0 Yet, I enjoy watching it.   1 Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.   0 Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!   0 The dialogue sucked.   0 The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.   0 The soundtrack sucked.   0 The acting sucked.   0 The concert sequences just sucked.   0 That was nice.   1 That was funny.   1 It was so funny.   1 Overall, this movie was cheap trash.   0 But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.   0 I came out of it feeling angry.   0 ***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.   1 The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.   1 Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).   1 And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.   1 All things considered, a job very well done.   1 Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.   1 One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.   1 It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.   1 The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.   1 It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.   1 Up there with the best of Melville.   1 Everything about this film is simply incredible.   1 You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.   1 BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.   1 The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.   1 I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.   1 I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.   0 If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.   0 There is a lot of beautiful places.   1 It was forced, like everything in this movie.   0 Again, lame.   0 Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.   0 And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.   0 When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.   0 Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.   0 The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.   0 The acting was bad.   0 Really bad.   0 Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.   0 Camerawork - again, bad.   0 Rating: 1 out of 10.   0 An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!   1 Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.   1 He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.   1 His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.   1 Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.   1 And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.   1 I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.   1 I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!   1 I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!   1 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.   1 I literally vomited while watching this film.   0 I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.   1 his performance, as awarded, was stunning.   1 the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.   1 In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.   1 All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.   1 I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.   0 But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap.	2

Preamble - Sentence three - delete: [t]hese Interconnection Procedures do  not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System. Insert:  These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of  Transmission Service on the Transmission System.  Sentence four - delete of the Transmission System Parts II and III are  defined terms.  Section 2.2 - Under this provision, if the Interconnection Customer makes  changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that  materially affect its interconnection it can lose its place in the queue.  Given how much discretion this gives PGE, materially affect should be a  defined term or have a standard for its application.  Section 3.1: Revise the last sentence as follows The Interconnection  Customer must execute, complete, and return . . .   Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function  desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection  procedures.   Section 3.4 This section should be amended to require that the short circuit  and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects.  Section 3.4(iii): Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission  service not just for interconnection. Accordingly, Section (iii) should be  changed to have the information studied for the customer's information only  or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue.	0

This ISO amendment was issued on 1/4/01 but I am not sure if anything was circulated to folks on the Trading Desk. The amendment allows the ISO to relax creditworthiness requirements to the utilities on a day to day basis. A copy of the transmittal letter is attached. The ISO has been invoking its order this week. See notice issued for tomorrow, below. If you have questions regarding this amendment, please do not hesitate to call me.	0

The Governor held his press conference today at the co-generation plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento. All local TV, print and radio news media outlets sent representatives. Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy, distributed generation and co-generation, it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities. The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities' financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines. He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity. He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities' lines, with the companies continuing to maintain them, to capture [the utilities'] expertise. Details of this plan will be announced on Friday, the Governor said. The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released.	0

Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts until FERC does an audit. It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts back to the generators first. It also claims that the PX could not suspend its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing. It asks the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero.	0

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California's largest utility, shoved to the brink  of bankruptcy by the state's power crisis, received a $1.1 billion lifeline  on Friday as its parent company turned over a massive federal tax refund to  keep operations going. Pacific Gas & Electric's financial boost from parent PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG -  news) will provide the giant utility with desperately needed funds to keep  serving its 13 million customers as the state's political leaders struggle  over a bail-out package. In a glimmer of optimism, corporate executives said on Friday that a bail-out  deal might be edging closer. But the cash infusion and bail-out progress came amid growing concern over  the financial health of California's two major utilities amid a crisis fueled  by the disastrous 1996 state electricity deregulation law that forced the  utilities to buy power on the spot market but refused them the right to pass  the higher prices on to consumers. On Friday, Pacific Gas & Electric said it would make good on only a segment  of debt payments due on April 2 -- adding to the mountain of unpaid paper the  utility has stacked up. Southern California Edison, the state's number two  utility, said it would fight any effort to push it into involuntary  bankruptcy. In Washington, meanwhile, federal regulators ordered six generators to either  justify why their prices were so high or refund $55 million to California  utilities for overpriced wholesale power sales in February. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) move followed a similar $69  million refund order against the same six generators last week for their  January sales, boosting California critics who have alleged that  ``out-of-state profiteers'' have exacerbated the state's critical energy  shortages. The crisis led power managers to impose rolling blackouts across parts of the  state twice in January, and federal Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said on  Thursday he believed more blackouts appeared ``inevitable'' this summer as  air conditioning pushes power demand sharply higher in the state. PG&E VOICES OPTIMISM Both Pacific Gas & Electric and its No. 2 rival, Edison International  (NYSE:EIX - news) unit Southern California Edison, have been fighting a  losing financial battle because the 1996 power deregulation law blocks them  from passing along soaring wholesale energy costs to consumers. As a result, the utilities are well over $13 billion in debt and say they  simply do not have the money to continue purchasing power for their customers. California Gov. Gray Davis, facing one of the worst economic crises ever to  hit the nation's richest and most populous state, has crafted a rescue  package which involves both emergency state purchases of power and an  elaborate bail-out for the utilities. But that bail-out, hinging on the state buying the utilities' vast network of  transmission lines, has run into trouble as negotiations bog down over the  price of the deal. On Friday, however, PG&E Corp. Chief Financial Officer Peter Darbee told a  teleconference with investors that the talks were on track.	0

I submitted the following RCRs for CA: Intervention in Support of Strategic Energy Enron supported Strategic's complaint against the CA ISO, regarding its  request to require the ISO release OOM (out of market) data publicly. ENA  (Tim Belden) has always had as a number one priority, release more data  sooner, and this filing offered an opportunity promote that concept. The  filing was made on 3/20/01. Opposition to ISO Compliance Filing On Creditworthiness Standards The ISO made a compliance filing that greatly expands its creditworthiness  exemptions, far beyond what FERC had ordered in its 2/14/01 order. The ISO's  tariff language can be read to allow the utilities to count the credit status  of third parties as their own, without the third parties' approvals. Enron  will oppose. The filing is due 3/22/01. Also Bracewell is making or has made the following CA filings (these are all  I know about anyway): Tucson Electric Complaint Intervention -- vanilla 3/19 Done for Sanders  -- no RCR PNM Complaint Support 3/22 Done for Sanders -- no RCR FERC Staff Report Support EPSA/WPTF 3/22 Plan to do for <$500 and raise temporal issue of western resources City of San Diego Intervene/comment 3/28 Probably will be done for Sanders The underscheduling filing was put on hold. We were mistaken when we thought  that comments on an ISO proposal were due 3/22. Instead, we've now decided  to file comments in response to the ISO's filing of tariff changes, which  should be made soon. That's all for the rest of March, so far. I'll be updating Jim's table on  pending FERC matters.	0

A few thoughts: First, I think it's dangerous for me to walk into any of the PNW Senator or  Congressman's offices and talk about our interests in legislation on the  retail side. Their key focus will be BPA and you (not me) are clearly the  expert on those issues. I am planning on handling (or others in the Western  States Group will handle) non-PNW states, but I think it makes more sense  for you to meet with the PNW folks (either with me or without me) because of  their focus on BPA issues.  Second, since you are already working so closely with Congressional staffers,  it may not be necessary to visit with the Senators and Congressmen when  they're home.  The only reason to do so, is that you do get better access to the members  themselves when they're home. In this regard, you may want to talk with  Cynthia and Craig Gannett about a visit with Slade Gorton, Gordon Smith, and  Ron Wyden.  I've met Smith (who probably won't remember me) and had dinner with Wyden at  former law partner's house (so he may remember me)--let me know what you  think. I'd be happy to join you and talk about state issues, but it only  makes sense in my mind if you are their to talk about BPA stuff.	0

Market Participants: The ISO provides this update regarding the Summer 2001 Demand Relief Program and the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program. The ISO intends to issue new solicitations for both programs in the next 1 1/2 weeks. Two additional RFBs for the Demand Relief Program, one for Loads only and one for Loads with back-up generators, are scheduled for issuance early next week with bids due May 1. They will be posted to our website and noticed by email. Based on ISO Governing Board approval on May 10, these Loads will begin participation in the Demand Relief Program on either June 1 or July 1, as feasible. The ISO Governing Board recently approved the design structure of the ISO Discretionary Load Curtailment Program. This program will be operable year-round. The ISO plans to issue the formal RFP in the next 1 1/2 weeks. Proposals will be accepted from aggregators on an ongoing basis. Additional details (subject to some change) can be found in Attachment A of the ISO Management Memo to the Governing Board dated March 7, 2001 and titled, Summer 2001 Preparedness Update and Demand Response Programs. (Note that pricing for the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program could be modified in the final design; the ISO expects to initiate the program in the $250-$500/MWh price range.)	0

I spoke with Lisa Urich, in-house attorney for the PX. She said that the bankruptcy filing did not list the collateral or dollars received as part of the PX's clearinghouse function as assets, and has been advised by the PX's bankruptcy attorney that they are not involved in the bankruptcy action. She said that the purpose of the bankruptcy filing relates only to vendors.	0

Good morning, everyone! I am sorry it has taken me so long to contact you. This e-mail is intended to get things rolling for the RTO West Legal Subgroup working on the Generation Integration and Load Integration Agreements, as well as Security Coordination and Scheduling Coordinator Agreements if necessary. First, for your reference I have attached the following documents: (1) a list of participants in our subgroup; (2) the original IndeGO Generation Integration Agreement (GIA); and (3) the original IndeGO Load Integration Agreement (LIA). If you know of anyone who would like to be included in this subgroup that does not appear on the attached participants list, please let me know. I will also post each of the attached documents on the RTO West website, at the link on the Legal Work Group page set up for our subgroup. Second, I would like to share some initial feedback I have received with respect to our assigned tasks: (A) Concerning the Generation GIA, I have the following initial feedback: - Carl Imparato has expressed strong concern about existing provisions in the GIA designed to address instances when hydro generation facility operators are forced to move water through turbines, rather than spill it, to avoid dissolved gas super-saturation problems; - James Mosher has expressed concern that the GIA as currently drafted does not adequately address issues unique to Qualifying Facilities, and would like us to work on that; and - Steve Larson of BPA has contacted me to let me know that BPA has developed some initial comments on the GIA (and LIA), but I have not yet had a chance to have a conversation with BPA representatives about what those comments are. I hope to do that sometime tomorrow (Thursday, June 22) if possible. (B) I have talked with John Boucher, who leads the Implementation Work Group, and he says that the initial consensus within the Implementation Work Group is that we should begin with the approach that security coordination for RTO West will be accomplished through the existing organization set up in the Northwest to perform security coordination (Pacific Northwest Security Coordinator or PNSC, which is a Washington non-profit corporation); and (C) John Boucher says that the initial thinking in the Implementation Work Group about scheduling coordinators as that we should assume that we will have scheduling coordinators for RTO West and therefore will need to develop a scheduling coordinator agreement. With that in mind, I have also attached to this e-mail an e-mail message from Barney Speckman on this topic. Barney's e-mail describes input he has received from Carl Imparato concerning areas in the West that have already developed scheduling coordinator agreements, and includes an e-mail from Carl with sample documents. I will also post these on the RTO West website as soon as possible, along with the basic form of Security Coordination Agreement developed for PNSC. I think it might be useful to plan to meet or have a telephone conference call during the week of July 10 (early in the week, if possible) to discuss our various tasks and strategies for accomplishing them. If most of you are going to be at the Legal Work Group meeting on June 27, that might be a good opportunity to try to identify a time and date that works for most subgroup members and to decide whether to meet in person or by telephone conference. I also hope to make initial cosmetic changes to the GIA and LIA very soon, and will put the initial revised versions of those documents on the website as soon as they are ready. In the meantime, if anyone else has some input they would like to offer with respect to the issues and documents assigned to our subgroup, you are welcome to contact me by e-mail or telephone. Thank you very much.	0

This is so much superior to the Kindle leather case with the band that I bought in September for 39.99.  The band lasted about two months, got loose then finally fell off.   bought this for mine and my sons kindle and its much better.   Re: help from amazon kindle, I always email and i have an answer usually within a few hours.  thats the way to go.  so far completely satisfied with customer service if i email.	1

The NERC Board of Trustees is scheduled to have a very important meeting on  Friday, March 30th, on the future organization of NERC-the so-called NERC to  NAERO transition. NERC is poised to eliminate its traditional board  structure, long dominated by its regional councils, and adopt an independent  board along with some form of a stakeholder advisory committee. This  watershed event provides an opportunity for EPSA, and its member companies,  to carefully evaluate participation in NERC, its committees and the  activities in the regions.  Specifically, we want to focus on what matters, if any, NERC is presently  addressing that warrant the continued attention and participation of EPSA  and/or its members. For those issues that are affecting, or could  potentially affect, the business interests of EPSA's members, what is the  most efficient and effective role EPSA could play? What is the best forum  for resolving reliability-related technical issues beyond FERC's expertise?  To facilitate this discussion, EPSA will be hosting a half-day summit to  discuss the outcome of NERC's March 30th meeting and its implications for  EPSA's allocation of resources to NERC activities on Wednesday, April 18 at  10 a.m. We encourage members to attend in person at the new EPSA offices at  1401 New York Ave., 11th Floor, Washington, D.C. However, we will also make  participation by conference call available. We encourage all companies,  whether or not they are currently active in NERC, to participate in this  important meeting.  Please RSVP for the meeting using the form below to Jackie Gallagher either  by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).	0
Please view the attachment and download the BPA tariff filing to the p: drive and let me know where it is. If you have trouble downloading fromt the FERC site, try BPA (my guess is that it will be easier to get from BPA than through FERC).	0
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.	1
The worst one of the series.	2

The RTO West Regional Representatives Group (RRG) meeting tentatively scheduled for Friday, June 15, has been cancelled. Good progress continues to be made on congestion management, planning, pricing, liability, and seams issues. Additional development of these issues by the work groups is necessary before they will be ready for RRG consideration. Thanks, too, for the suggestions several of you have given us for potential consultants for the cost-benefit analysis. Assuming no major conflicts, we have tentatively scheduled Friday, June 29, for the next RRG meeting. We will confirm or re-schedule this June 29 meeting date as soon as we can. Have a pleasant weekend.	0

boy oh boy were my taste buds in for a treat after being warmly greeted by the coownerhostessipoddj we started with poached pears baked in raw honey with roquefort and drizzled with balsamic dressing and complemented by wine from nextdoor byob and no corkage how deliciously affordable the other owner her husband stopped by our table to chat us up he has managed nightclubs and restaurants in nyc for the better part of 15 years and is a charismatic whirlwind but back to the food my friend went with the forest mushroom ragout stewed with tofu carrots spicy sprouts and caribbean beans while i opted for free range chicken breast marinated in lime jus and jerk spices with chevre and papaya puree so tender moist and dripping with taste that sounded dirty didnt it but im talking about some damn good cooking and the portions so generous even little miss piggy here couldnt finish her supper when it came to dessert however this little piggy had none	1

It is very comfortable on the ear.	1
Meh. I think Singles are a bad idea. Big name authors already dominate the market by a huge factor. Now you are letting them compete on price point with indie authors (albeit giving less content for the money).	2

This morning Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett held a press conference on her AB  128x. Several print journalists and 3 TV cameras were present at the  conference. Also of interest is that the Senate tax consultants and Burton's  staff were at the event. Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson showed up late  and gave a few quotes to the media present. A spokesman from Mirant also  gave a few interviews after the press conference. According to Corbett's staff, they expect to handout the bill amendments at  the hearing. Among Corbett's comments to the media present: This bill is not a negotiating tool. I'm very serious about this bill. I  want to see it through the process. The Governor will sign a bill like this.	0
The service was not up to par, either.	2

It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.	1
Definitely worth seeingÂ… it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.	1
an absolutely divine place in harvard square enjoyed the decor a bite of chocolate cake and shared some house mint tea with peeps definitely returning very soon lovelovelovelovelove it	1

The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	1
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	2
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!	1
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1
im not a vegetarian or vegan so when this place was recommended to me i was skeptical i decided to try it though and it is so delicious i have been here a bunch recently and i havent had a bad dish to order here you choose one of three pizza dough brown rice or coconut rice and an entree to go on top they have daily specials which are delicious and soups of the week i just recently had tomato and lentil soup which was delicious also it is a small space and is part of a music club club passim you will be asked upon entering if youre there for the show or for dinner you may have to wait for a table especially if you have 4 people and takeout is always a fast delicious option also before 4 or 5pm there are no waiters so you just place your order through a window to the cook it is a little hard to find take a look at the pictures on yelp its a basement and connected to club passim so if youre going here at night you may hear music from the club just follow that and youll figure it out they also have 2 beers on tap and desserts	1
In a word, it is embarrassing.	2
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.	1

Best present i ever got was my kindle!! the battery lasts for months!!	1
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.	2
i decided not to go b/c nobody really had any plans.  i didn't want to drive  either.  chad is moving tomorrow.  are you guys partying this weekend?	0
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.	2
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	2
I would not recommend this item to anyone.	2
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	2

DSTAR does indeed still have the bad governance problem to which you alluded. On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent Governing Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty reasonable and pro-markets. So on the key issue of governance, what I think we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that the Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always be 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more likely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws regarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more equitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.	0

Hi Sarah, Here is the compilation of ADR-related options.. I haven't yet received anything from Mary or Don, so these sections are not included in this version. I started to incorporate the various pieces of this into the ADR provision itself, but it quickly became clear that was not going to be a productive task until we narrow the options. I will not be in Portland next week, but will dial in if that option is available.	0

flat out mani osteria is amazing this place sets the standard by which other restaurants in ann arbor should be judged whenever i go somewhere else i ask myself sure this place is good but is it mani good sure sometimes it is hard to get a table here but it is well worth it mani makes amazing pizza by new york standards i would rate its pizza as being comparable to co in nyc link httpwwwyelpcombizconewyork all of the food here is delicious but the pizzas are outstanding lovely thin crust pizzas with heavenly bubbly burnt bits on the outer crust they know what they are doing in that kitchen also for my beerdrinking friends out there they have a nice selection of beer featuring rotating taps of michigan beers good wines are also available ive heard although i cant attest to that as kendall jackson is good enough for me in that domain the staff is incredibly attentive and there are lots of them at first glance it appears the place is overstaffed however all of them are hard at work attending to everyones needs and overall making your experience great none of them are standing idly by waiting for something to do the whole seeminglyoverstaffed bunch is working hard which translates well for guests noteworthy ive been here four times now and there hasnt been a bad pie nor a bad experience in the bunch that is significant while yelp allows reviews that are updates of a place those review are few and far between so most of the reviews that go into star ratings are of peoples first experiences which we are mostly positivelybiased ive been here four times and each time it has been fantastic that goes a long way for speaking to how consistently great this place is protip come for lunch the weekday happy hour or a sunday dinner as its much easier to get a table then on fridays and saturdays the place is packed and it can be near impossible to get a table within an hour all in all mani is just amazing all of the elements of this place come together in an amazing experience of great food and great times this is my standby place to go to when i want great pizza in a city with poor pizza options and even more mani is my standby place to go to get a great meal in a city with amazing food options take home point if you havent been to mani yet you havent yet had the best food in ann arbor	1

This Notice confirms our next RTO West Regional Representatives Group (RRG) meeting for Friday, June 1. The meeting will be held at our usual place - the Portland Sheraton Airport Hotel, Columbian Rooms, from 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.  The working agenda for the meeting is:  1. Congestion Management  The Congestion Management work groups have performed indefatigably in developing a consensus model that we envision will be the basis for the very substantial amount of congestion management work that lies immediately ahead. The model will be presented by Kristi and Barney for full RRG discussion as the first agenda item.  2. Stage 2 Filing Plan and Schedule  We're still putting the plan and schedule together for your review.  We appreciate the helpful comments on scheduling that many of you gave us at our May 4 RRG meeting. We've tried to accommodate your views as much as we could. Here are the assumptions that are guiding the Stage 2 Filing Plan and Schedule:  a. There will be an August 31 interim filing and a December 1  completion filing.  b. The August 31 filing will include information about key  components of RTO West, such as the congestion management model, an illustrative pricing model, planning/expansion principles, and lists of facilities for inclusion.  c. Work will continue to be sequenced. For example, after  essential congestion management work is completed, work on losses, and ancillary services will commence as soon as possible. This sequencing will require a major effort on congestion management with tight deadlines over the next five weeks. Work on all items needed for a completion filing in December will commence as determined appropriate.  d. Work on underlying RTO liability issues will continue in  parallel throughout the near-term schedule.  We'll have a fuller plan and schedule for your review on June 1.  3. Report on RTO West Technical Conference with FERC on Liability  We will give you a report on the RTO West technical conference that is being held today at FERC on liability. As you know, in the April 26 RTO West order, the Commission rejected the entire liability program. An objective of the technical conference is to explain the filing utilities' concerns about risk allocation and liability and try to find an approach that can resolve these concerns.  4. Benefit Cost Analysis  As we previewed at our May 4 RRG meeting, we have initiated  discussions with some potential contractors who could assist in developing a new RTO West benefit-cost analysis. We will report to you on the status of those discussions and the next steps to move ahead on this important issue.  This Notice is being sent to you via our new exploder system, so I hope it goes only to those who have told us they want to receive it. Please do not reply to this e-mail as your reply will go to the entire RRG list of 400+ folks. We've already annoyed enough of you as it is.  Thanks very much, and we look forward to seeing you on June 1.	0

im a mostlyveggie eater and i love this place their portabello sandwich is among the best ive ever had apparently smoking is the secret to cooking a big mushroom all the way through evenly and flavorfully the catfish is also delicious love getting a flight of sauces and working my way through them between dinner and the excellent sides i highly recommend the sweet potato fries and if its summer the smoked sweet corn yum as most everyone else has said the meats are also delicious according to my husband and the tons of people weve brought here for lunch or dinner their tap list is relatively small they usually have somewhere around 7 beers at a time but theres always lovely choices recently theres been some absolutely delicious dark pumpkin apple fall beers bar and food service sometimes seems rushed but surprisingly good for how busy they get this place is insanely busy at pretty much all hours 30min wait at 830pm on a wednesday but it has still become our default for outoftown guests that says a whole heck of a lot	1

i find that i have less to say about the places i like the best the atmosphere was very comfortable the staff was accommodating and attentive the food pizza pappardelle fig and gorgonzola salad was all fresh with rich flavors but light on the stomach the price was a bit high but i felt ok about paying it because i couldnt think of any way they could have done better my background is italian so i am a pretty tough critic of italian food but this is probably the best ive found in a2 and a strong contender even when compared to larger cities	1
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content.

Lets all try to persuade Kindle to allow us to download snooks from our local Libraries.   Your Library may not provide this facility now but it will, I believe, very soon.   Be prepared.

wow we just had a fantastic dinner at logan we had had lunch there shortly after it opened several years ago and i had been underwhelmed by the limited lunch menu and the food shame on me for judging a new restaurant by its lunch menu ive missed many amazing dinners here as a result everything on the menu sounded fantastic and there are many choices the dinner started out nicely with a tasty potatoleekfennel pollen soup as an amusebouche i had the green papaya salad which is like a party in your mouth we both had the veal breast as an entree it was unctuous and succulent and absolutely delicious as were the cranberry beans that accompanied it the biscuits were light and tender and i could have eaten the entire plate of them myself i skipped dessert but my husband said the poached pear spring roll was fantastic im looking forward to getting loose in the app and pasta sections of the menu on a return visitthe crispy sweetbreads tapenade gnocchi and wild boar bolognese unfortunately they had run out of it the night we were there are calling my name the restaurant is cozy and comfortable and service by larry was outstanding also we had known kevin one of the ownersthe guy who runs the front of the housesommelier from his days at five lakes grill in milford and even though we hadnt seen him for years he remembered exactly what we used to drink there impressive in addition to being a great host he really knows his food and wine logan has an excellent wine list and will steer you in the right direction on both if you ask	1

It's been a few years since I reviewed the case law on this.

did anyone else read how opal mehta got kissed got wild and got a life you know the book written by a harvard freshman a couple years ago but was quickly taken off the market because it turned out to contain whole paragraphs plagiarized from another authors books anyway at the end of that book the heroine finally achieves her dream of getting accepted by harvard and finds herself sitting at bartleys with a group of fellow john harvards as she bites into her george bush burger cheesy grease and bbq sauce drip down her chin and she is filled with happiness beyond anything she had ever experienced reading that i knew that i too wanted to eat at bartleys in the spirit of the 2004 elections i ordered the john kerry burger he voted this the best burger before he voted against it a swiss cheese burger with mushrooms tomato lettuce and fries it was amazing total love at first bite the meat was tender and juicy and the whole thing was cheesy savory and deliciously greasy a few bites in my chin was dripping with meat juice and ketchup and chunks of halfchewed mushrooms my attractiveness might have been at an all time low but id never been happier it was a truly transcendental burger experience thank you opal mehta ina k put it best when she said this place is an institution granted she was talking about a completely different restaurant in a different state but still the words fit a boston landmark since 1960 im sad to see it go update apparently the close is temporary there was a kitchen fire and the place is only closed until they repair the damage phew	1

Please find below the first glimpse of the plan to update, and review, the largest 50 curves; they represent 75% of URM exposure. I am confident of your cooperation and support; both are absolutely essential to complete this ambitious schedule on time (the process will start on April 23rd and conclude by May 25th, 2001). Stella, Pat and I are currently working on streamlining the regulatory inputs  required from you in a faster, and more cost-effective manner. We are also  working on ensuring that documentation will be compiled in a very user  friendly database (with the help/support of Elizabeth it shall be on the  intranet) that will make the process next time a cinch, and provide the  required inputs for your suggested strategy for the curve/utility when the  time comes (it is the second stage of the process).  Stella, Pat and I shall seek your permission for an appropriate time this  coming week to discuss the details of the plan and take stock of your  comments and suggestions.	0

I love it.   1 The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.   1 I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.   1 I will never forget it now.   1 It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.   1 Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.   0 The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.   0 This movie is terrible.   0 The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.   0 For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!   0 To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!   0 Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.   0 In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.   0 It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.   0 The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.   0 By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.   0 Glad I didn't pay to see it.   0 Didn't laugh or even smile once.   0 But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...   0 It is a really good show to watch.   1 It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.   1 Barney is definitely super DE duper.   1 is pretty funny.   1 Babie Bop is very cute.   1 The kids are very cool too.   1  But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.	2

The $150 soft price cap that FERC adopted in its December 15 order applies  only to sales of power into the California ISO market and California PX  day-aheadand day-of markets. These are the real-time and short-term markets,  respectively. By the terms of the December 15 order, the cap does not apply  to any bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. of  Water Resources (CDWR), which are generally for longer terms.  Given the instability of the California market, the current applicability of  the cap may change in the future. In a recentlly released report, FERC staff  recommends that the cap be discontinued after April 2001 and replace by a  series of other measures to mitigate market power. Thes include a marginal  cost price cap on sales into the ISO by sellers who are party to the  participating generator agreement.  Although unlikely, it is not inconceivable that someone in the future might  argue that the role currently being performed by CDWR is in some respects the  same role as was formerly performed by the PX. Based on that proposiiton, it  might be argued that a price cap similar to the soft price cap be imposed  on sales to the CDWR.	0

i have to admit that every pizza place ive ever been to in my adult life has been held in comparison to arnis i grew up on arnis and i know everyone always says whatever pizza they grew up on is the best but in this case its 100 true arnis is thincrust cut into squares and is very generous with the toppings greasy as all heck so definitely not good for you in any way shape or form every year or so when i travel back to visit the family arnis is either my very first stop or its a place i go to shortly after i get there if i could figure out how to have my dad ship me out a fresh arnis pizza i would probably have to do it every month or so best pizza in the world hands down	1

this place is great they have a lot of cocktails so you can go here plenty of times without having to drink the same drink twice and they are all great they also have good beer and a pretty big wine list though ive never had wine here the food looks amazing but i havent had dinner here yet i have had the chips and dip though both the chips and the dip are homemade and so amazingly delicious i wont look at chips the same way again sundays are stout oyster night where with every stout you get you also get a free oyster i love sundays here wednesdays are mexicantheme and they have a whole list of cocktails made with tequila they also have a mexicantheme snack list for wednesdays both nights are fun and delicious the atmosphere is maybe the best part for me green street has a cozy intimate feeling while still having a chic feel the music is usually soul and funk which i love but there are other styles mixed in the staff is friendly and good at their jobs if youre having a hard time finding the place youre not alone it looks sketchy from the outside but is amazing on the inside the best advise i have is to look at the pictures on yelp if you take a look at them youll have a much easier time finding it	1

It is true that the CEC awarded us a contract for $1.5MM of grants under  the AB970 program. I use quotes around the award because we had responded  only to an RFQ, not an RFP, so the issuance of the award based only on an  RFQ was unusual (perhaps due to urgency of program). As the RFQ didn't  include any terms and conditions, after the award, we started negotiating  the terms and conditions of the contract. We have been hung up on  consequential damages and indemnities, so on March 12 I prepared a mini-TAF  covering these issues for executive approval. George Hernandez' assistant  picked up the mini-TAF on March 13. I haven't seen it since and so I don't  know whether the mini-TAF was fully signed or not. George is out of the  office and I have just left his assistant a message. I am hopeful that no  one has signed the actual contract pending approval of the mini-TAF. If I can track down the status of the mini-TAF I'll re-send an email with  status.	0

If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings. (Also, Enron generally has to also file for EWG Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not required.)	0

This excellent material, and very important, but it's pretty esoteric. If you want to really kick the ISO and Davis in the shins, use Mary's stuff about the ISO derating the transmission line at COB. Assuming it's true that the ISO has effectively shut down the northbound transmission route at the Oregon border in order to hoard power, and that this raised the market price in the NW by about $50-75 per megawatt-hour, and that this is costing the NW $2-5 million per day (at least for the period that Mary looked at), that will send the NW Senators into low earth orbit. If we can establish that this derating ruse was a change adopted by Davis's handpicked ISO board, the NW Senators will escape Earth's gravitational pull. For that very reason, we have to be able to back up anything we say, and we need to anticipate any defenses the ISO may have. But if you want NW elected officials to quit being so polite toward Davis, that will do it.	0

the food is good the drinks are excellent and expensive but the reason i went to noir at least once a week all summer long was to relax on the outdoor patio with a martini and a cigarette late at night and do some quality people watching and gossiping with my good friend and noir is an excellent venue for such things	1

one of the coziest spots in harvard square on a winter evening love the brick walls and the cheap menu the half price menu is a real steal and worth the trek out to cambridge usually just go for appetizers when with friends and we often get the hot spinach and artichoke dip my best friend and i were fans of an appetizer that is no longer featured bread with tomato sauce but regardless of the menu changes i still enjoy myself when i go to grendels whether its a humid summer night and you are sitting outside or cozying up inside on a winter night gendels is a spot where you will find yourself comfortable and at home among strangers	1
good food good beer	1
so i was really in love with zingermans and no doubt zingermans is good stuff but then i thought about it how realistic is it to pay 15 for a freaking sandwich not very realistic at all the perfect solution is here at maize and blue i think the quality is almost as good as zingermans and for half the price this place really has a ton of sandwiches i was reading their sandwich menu board for quite a while i think there are literally over 100 anyway in the end i got the reuben and the maize and blue special which consists of turkey roast beef some wasabi type mustard cheese and the usual veggies wow they were both so good i must also mention that you can get 12 the meat for 125 less i ended up doing this and i cant even imagine what a normal sandwich is because with 12 the meat the thing was still overflowing with meat so i guess if you are a big protein kind of person thats perfect for you	1

On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor  Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional  transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts. It argues that such a  transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power  Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest. It  also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring  the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale  sales to date.	0

the food and baked goods are so good and i think that the best complement i have for this place is that it was literally the first food i had after having my baby i had been going through a period of intense flour sticky bun cravings for a few weeks and happened to have a sticky bun sitting on my counter at home waiting for me when i went into labor i had to leave it at home and my sister who was visiting ended up eating it i knew this would happen i mused sitting in my hospital bed so my dear dear husband surprised me with a selection of flour sandwiches and sticky buns for lunch after i had finished the business of having a baby thus making a memorable event even more memorable	1

The following is an excerpt from a FERC order issued on Friday: Ridgewood Power LLC (Ridgewood) filed comments suggesting that the shortage of supply could be remedied in part by relaxing the operating efficiency and other regulatory requirements pertaining to Qualifying Facilities (QFs). Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs). Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements. With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak and off-peak periods. Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or into the competitive market their above-baseline output for a limited time period. Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's regulations provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency standards upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy savings. However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's goals. We find that many of these same factors are present here. Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through increasing the availability of needed capacity. Therefore, we will grant temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order. We will terminate the waiver effective January 1, 2001.	0

I exchanged v-mails with Elena Scmid at the ISO. The leaked information  pertains to a filing to be made at FERC today that responds to the FERC  Staff's report on market mitigation. The ISO had last week released its own  proposed market mitigation plan -- or, as they referred to it, the market  stabilization plan. There was much negative response to it. I spoke against  it at the Board meeting and submitted written comments in opposition. The  Board blessed it in concept and agreed to the let the staff file it, but to  ask the staff for a few changes. I would be surprised if much has changed  since we've seen it. Along with the filing are two staff reports, one by  Angeli and one by Eric Hildebrandt that identifyy what they see as market  power. According the Elena, she does not believe that the reports use the  term gouging. These reports are just extenstions of what we've seen from  the ISO before. Previously, the ISO talked about $650 million or so in  potential refunds. These reports extend the time period of the analysis.  I've asked Elena to let me know if Enron is named and when it will be  posted. Elena says that the ISO also asks for the mitigation period to be at  all times not just at 5% of the time as FERC has sugested. It is not yet posted on the ISO web site. The ISO is holding press  conference now and I'm listening in.	0

I understand that the some of the Democratic leadership of the California Legislature is contemplating a charge against the electric-generating industry in retaliation for recent price increases. The charge is to be styled as a windfall profit tax modeled on President Carter's tax on oil company profits following deregulation of oil prices in 1980 (The Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980, 26 USC 4986 et seq.). The Carter Windfall Profit Tax was levied on the difference between the current wellhead price of the oil and the sum of the adjusted base price set by Congress, multiplied by the applicable rate. I understand the California charge will similarly be calculated by reference to a 1999 base price and current prices, to which difference some sort of tax rate will be applied. You asked whether this approach to punishing electric wholesalers was infirm from either a policy or legal perspective. The basic policy problem is that the tax will discourage sales of electricity in California. California will become the market of last resort. Another problem is that the Tax might be seen as promoting a California First policy at the expense of other states. This is so because the Tax could well be included in the FERC rate base as taxes other than income taxes, and thereby be shifted to other customers.	0

The broader bankruptcy reform bill is expected to be approved by the Senate  by the end of the week.  Separately, talks between California and its three investor owned utilities  on a deal under which the state might buy their transmission assets continued  this week with no deal in sight.  The state is negotiating with PG&E and Edison, along with Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE - news) unit San Diego Gas and Electric.  The deals are aimed mainly at pumping money into PG&E and SoCal Edison to  keep them out of bankruptcy after they recorded about $13 billion in red ink  since last spring, paying sky-high prices for power in the wholesale market.  PG&E and SoCal Edison, under the terms of the state's disastrous experiment  with market deregulation, have been able to pass on to their retail customers  only a fraction of their power purchase costs.	0

I am amending my previous statement about the 2-year delay in creating a multi-state RTO. If FERC were to decertify the CAISO and order the CA utilities to join a regional RTO, I believe that DSTAR, the California IOUs and the CAISO infrastructure/staff/systems could easily merge and be up and running as a large Desert Southwest + California RTO before the end of the year. This was basically what I had been trying to achieve last summer when I was facilitating talks between CAISO and DSTAR parties about merging the two.	0

SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- With blackouts again rolling across the state and  lawmakers losing faith in Gov. Gray Davis, legislators called for the  resignation of the state's top utility regulator and threatened to cut off  further money for buying electricity. The second straight day of blackouts, in which power had to be cut to the  equivalent of 500,000 homes, resulted from a combination of unseasonably warm  temperatures and a high-level of power-plant outages. Those factors are  likely to worsen as a warm spring turns to a hot summer, and Californians  switch on air conditioning. The continuing crisis, originally sparked by a utility-deregulation plan gone  awry, is draining the patience of political and business leaders, who are  stepping up their criticisms of Gov. Davis. Tuesday, Assembly Republican  Leader Bill Campbell of Orange County called on Mr. Davis's appointee, Public  Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, to resign, and for the governor  to replace her with an energy expert in which Californians could have  complete confidence. Ms. Lynch, an attorney, had no background in energy or utilities when the  governor appointed her as PUC chief a year ago, long before any blackouts. We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in  solving this energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead, Mr. Campbell wrote  the governor in a letter released Tuesday. Leaders seek to eliminate  barriers to progress. Loretta Lynch stands in the way of a quick solution to  California's energy problem.	0

He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the $10 billion in long-term debt. Connell said the scope of the proposed transfer is unprecedented and amounts to a shell game that disguises the power purchases' impact on the state budget. Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity purchases. If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the state's finances, he said. At some point we're going to run out of money. The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from  Assembly Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering challenging Davis next year.	0

Per our conversation on the RTO conference call this am, please make sure and run the proposed details/rules of any real time market you are working on by Kevin Presto and Tim Belden before Enron agrees or proposes anything. Kevin wants to have the generation curve and demand curve available. However, there are many ways to set up such a market and the traders need to be involved (maybe with another meeting later). For example, there are different ways of the dispatcher responding to bids, such as set point dispatch or sending out a price signal (what PJM does)--(probably many other methods too.) In addition, Kevin does not like the way that NY can take out of merit generators.	0
@ C.j.:  Because that is what I do professionally...working for programs that teach illiterate adults here and abroad.  And in the developing countries, most of the adults are functionally illiterate--not their fault.  The capitalized sentence wasnt to ooze sarcasm at the people, but at the idea we can send technology and it will all magically be better.  Trust me on this:  learning to read as an adult is hard work, and only happens with lots of work by the teachers/tutors and the students.	2

its always a good sign from the brunch gods when the first thing to arrive at your table after the water is a basket of sticky buns coffee cake lemon poppy muffins and savory baconcheese scones and when said sticky buns taste like butter draped in caramel and you can literally taste the sour cream oozing out of the coffee cakeits pretty much guaranteed that you are in for a treat the hits just kept on coming when my eggs benedict with pancetta and a side of red roasted potatoes arrived the english muffin was nicely toastey and buttery the bacon was crisp and salty the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise was not too thick the potatoes needed a little bit of salt but were otherwise tender and made a nice vehicle to soak up the runny egg yolks and extra sauce for dessert my friend and i split the french toast which was 3 fluffy buttery triangles of clearly deepfried brioche bathed in a caramel sauce with sliced bananas candied pecans and a dollop of mascarpone cheese i dont really think i need to say any more than that amazing they had a short list of inventive breakfast cocktails that go beyond the traditional mimosa or bellini mine was called hits of sunshine and consisted of champagne with raspberry puree and elderflower liquer which was tart flowery and refreshing my friends passionfruit honey liquer and champagne concoction was the winner though with its sweet taste and velvety texture the atmosphere was quirky lively and sunny at least in the monday club room where we sat the carpets are leopardprint the walls are magenta or green if youre by the bar you feel a bit like youre at the mad hatters tea party but in a good way its nice to eat at a restaurant that is serious about good food but a little more lighthearted about everything else	1

Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversations with some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of Guiding Principles on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference on January 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISO markets.

Greetings,?members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff Integration Group. As those of you who were able to attend the RRG meeting on March 23 may  recall, we received a number of suggestions that the Stage 2 work process be  restructured to a more sequenced approach.? That is, in the near term we  should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional work  efforts once the critical path items have been more fully developed. In response to these suggestions, we have substantially revised the RTO West  meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the entire month of  April.? The revised calendar has now been posted on the RTO West Stage 2  Main Page, which you can view by clicking on the link below: http://208.55.67.64/Stage2Index.htm The specific effect this near-term re-focusing will have on the Tariff  Integration Group is that?tariff work will be suspended for a time while  other work takes?first priority.? The Tariff Integration Group meetings  previously scheduled for April 4 and April?18 have been canceled.? The March  30 conference call that was set up specifically to discuss ADR will be held  as planned, however.? If you would like to join that conference call, it  will be on Friday, March 30 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Pacific Time.??The  dial-in will be 503-813-5808, passcode 964949. I apologize if these changes cause you any inconvenience.? We?appreciate the  valuable contributions and dedication you have already brought to this  process, and we look forward to getting back to?work with all of you as soon  as some of the other critical path items have gotten more fully developed.	0

I love it.   1 The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.   1 I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.   1 I will never forget it now.   1 It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.   1 Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.   0 The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.   0 This movie is terrible.   0 The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.   0 For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!   0 To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!   0 Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.   0 In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.   0 It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.   0 The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.   0 By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.   0 Glad I didn't pay to see it.   0 Didn't laugh or even smile once.   0 But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...   0 It is a really good show to watch.   1 It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.   1 Barney is definitely super DE duper.   1 is pretty funny.   1 Babie Bop is very cute.   1 The kids are very cool too.   1  But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.	2

This Notice postpones our tentatively scheduled RTO West Regional  Representatives Group Meeting from April 20 to May 4.? As most of you know,  substantial work is on-going in the areas of congestion management and  contract conversion.? With respect to congestion management, the RTO West  filing utilities are working together with other stakeholders to consider  refinements to the Stage 1 congestion model.? There is an additional effort  among the filing utilities to develop a possible alternative to the Stage 1  model.? These efforts will be among the topics at the May 4 meeting.? When  we get closer to the meeting date, I'll send a notice on specific time and  location. At our March 23 RRG meeting, I briefed everyone on my discussions with a  FERC staff member on the status of the RTO West October 23 filing.? I was  told that the FERC Commissioners wanted to hold a meeting in the West to get  the views of western states' representatives on RTOs (and critical pricing,  grid enhancements, generation, and other infrastructure issues) before they  took up the RTO West filing.? In its Order issued March 16, Docket No.  PL01-3-000, entitled Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation  and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States,? FERC stated that it  saw a west wide RTO, or a seamless integration of Western RTOs, as the best  vehicle for designing and implementing a long-term regional solution.	0

I heard through the grapevine that you have concerns about what we are doing. Just to clarify: We are planning to file on 3/22 in response to the ISO's  filing to continue to calculate but not charge the penalty. We will oppose  the ISO and ask that the ISO charge it. We are not going to withdraw our previous filing in support of the utilities. If you have any concerns, please contact me before the end of today. Or I  can set up a conference call if you like.	0

THE LA Times was wrong in its assertion that the ISO was asking for $5.5  billion in refunds. The filing is submitting comments to FERC. The ISO  said that the purpose of the filing is to ask FERC to be more aggressive in  their approach to market mitigation and provide context to FERC for its  decision. The report the ISO staff has done covers the period from May 2000  to Feb 2001 and calculates that prices exceeded what they would expect in a  competitive market by $6.2 billion. The ISO states that it is not claiming  that these are overcharges. They understand that other factors are in play  and that the ISO does not have access to the generator cost data -- so they  are unable to say how much of the dollars are overcharges. ISO General Counsel said he can't tell how much is an overcharge, how much  should be refunded, how much might be unjust and unreasonable. ISO is  working with other state agencies, AG, CPUC, EOB, and don't know if the  action should be taken at FERC, the courts, ... In the press conference, the news reporters are using the term gouging and  the ISO is not using that term, but not necessarily correcting the reporters.	0
Thanks for the draft. We are informed that the PX has filed in Chapter 11. It may argue that FERC's proceedings fall within the automatic stay, and that even if they don't, the accounting we are proposing inappropriately overlaps the role of the bankruptcy court.	0

jacques-  i think i should be able to go that weekend.  just wanted to let you know  since i hadn't rsvp'd.	0
Attached for your review is a draft of a Motion to Intervene Out of Time that will enable you to be parties in Docket No. ER01-902-000, the proceeding in which the PX sought to amend its tariff to relax its creditworthiness standards. In particular, please read the description of your entity under Section II for accuracy. If you have any questions or revisions, you may contact me by return email, or by phone at 202.828.7623.	0
We filed with FERC today a final version of this (which I don't yet have). We need to discuss Enron Wind doing the same. Also, you'd need to send a letter to the PX terminating your particiaption agreement. I'll send you the letter we sent. I'm assuming you would want to get out of the CTS market as well as the Day-ahead and Day-of. Call me ASAP 503-464-8862. Thanks.	0
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.	2

On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.	1
this place rocked my sloan friend took me here for saturday lunch and it totally exceeded all my expectations i loved how fluffy the crepes were too often the crepes are too rich and oily making you feel gross afterward but the eiffel tower crepe was just perfect with plenty of flavor without overloading the crepe with too much cheese and oil im not sure if ive had a better crepe i wish stanford had a place like this right next to campus	1

Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.	2
With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.   1 Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.   1 Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.   1 1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?   0 Lots of holes in the script.   0 It's like a bad two hour TV movie.   0 Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.   0 The dialogue is atrocious.   0 The acting is beyond abysmal.   0 Everything stinks.   0 Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.   0 Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.   0 It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.   0 In short, don't bother with this movie.   0 I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.   1 The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.   1 If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!   1 The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.   1 A film not easily forgotten.   1 But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor.   1 The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.   1 The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.   1 Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!   1 Great movie!   1 Also the story and acting were weak.   0 At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.   0 Either way, it sucks.   0 The script is horrendously stupid.   0 The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.   0 Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.   0 What the hell kind of crap is that?!   0 Then, there's the plot holes.   0 You could drive a semi truck into these holes!   0 Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.   1 She's poised and amazing.   1 Dee Snider just plain sucks.   0 He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?   0 I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.   0 The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.   0 This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.   0 This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.   0 A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.   0 Avoid at any and all costs.   0 At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.   0 Avoid this film at all costs.   0 I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.   0 The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.   0 Now this is a movie I really dislike.   0 It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.   0 The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.   0 The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.   0 There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.   0 I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.   0 The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.   1 The best part about Nurse Betty is it's unpredictability.	1
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use	1

sometimes b wakes up turns to me and says i want pinkberry so i roll over and oh me i realize that he is actually referring to the tangy cool frozen yogurt product that we enjoyed in nyc low and behold yelp points me to berryline and all is well b rad and i hit up the cute little shoppe one fine evening and stood in the line that went out the door full of other peeps eager for a creamy probiotic confection if you are not on your toes the pressure can build when it is your turn to order and you havent quite decided what to get the toppings really need to be scoped out unless you can read the sign up by the counter with the choices are you fruity or more of a candy ass tough call how about a combo i wanted kiwi and chocolate no dice player the young chapling at the counter said they were all out of chocochips the horror all fruity for me then i selected the original yogurt flavor with luscious kiwi and pineapple i like my fruit like i like my teenage boys fresh and ripe oh and it was they had other yogurt flavors blueberry and cranberry that evening i was tempted by these choices but the original tangy flavor compliments bold fruitiness so well my b also chose original and selected reeses pieces and oreo i was so proud the small size was perfecto and two overflowing topping choices hit the spot for i didnt have any dinner that evening tis okay if i dont have my required daily intake of sweetnessme go crazzzzzzzzy the prices are cheaper than the pinkberry and the quality to me was just as good berryline is bradget approved teee heeee awww precious	1

I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!	1
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.	2
In light of the opening of the energy industry, the Mexican Bar Association  has been asked by different sectors to create the Energy Law Committee. I am  pleased to?inform you that I have been asked to chair such committee. As part of our endevors, we will be involved in the upcoming reforms to the  energy industry.	0
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	1

The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI) system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on 4/1/01. When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for Trade Date 4/1/01, which is considered a Short day because an hour is lost, SC's should schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for HE03 being zeroed out in the template or blanked out when using the CAISO SI Web Workspace to submit schedules. The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data from/to the SI database for the Short day's HE03. Therefore, no data will be sent to settlements for this hour. Consequently, settlements will have only 23 records for this Short day, Trade Date 4/1/01. If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade date, please contact Ginger Seitles, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-4420.	0
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionn (FERC) has changed the start time of the Technical Conference scheduled for Tuesday, June 19, 2001. The meeting will now begin at 11:00 a.m. E.T.

We should probably make sure we're coordinated on this one. Greg Wolfe has a history on this one--apparently we've been contacted by Puget in the past, by certain of the customers in the past, and by consultants to the customers. Also, Dave Fuller was inquiring about Puget's customers as well.	0

It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.	1

their granola with fruit is top notch their waffles are delish we like coming here for dinner since the wait on weekends for brunch is ridonculous as much as i like my pancakes im not waiting one friggin hour for them atmosphere is quirky eccentric and funwelcome to cambridge friends usually packed with lots of mit students which is obvious when you start hearing the folks at the neighboring table start talking about semiconductors mechanical engineering and sht while the service can be inconsistent at times what can i say i love this place	1

Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1
awesome food selected from either seasonal menu or daily options the meatloaf which is currently standard was delicious and the green bean and sweet potato tempura starter was light and very tasty the dessert the girl scout trio consisting of their take on samoas tagalongs and thin mints was well orgasmic the waitress roxanne whom i told did not have to put on her red dress was sweet and not overly attentive oh and its byob i will definitely be back	1

I want verification from Tim, Chris Calger, and you that working on the RTO West tariff and generation interconnect agreement is consistent with my new narrower role as regulatory attorney for the West power desk and the apporpriate priority for use of my time.

Attached find two drafts, one a redline/strikeout and the other a clean first draft of the RTO West tariff glossary. In addition to making the changes we discussed to the Transmission Operating Agreement, I also took the liberty of adding a number of definitions that I cribbed from the FERC pro forma (changing Transmisison Provider to RTO West where applicable). I recognize that some of these definitions may not be applicable to the new types of transmisison service but I thought if we made these definitions available to the technical groups they could tell us if they needed them and we would be assured that terms were used consistently with the FERC pro forma and throughout the RTO West tariff.	0
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	2
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.	2
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	2
Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.	1
iPad + Kindle app = AWESOME!	1
Disappointed!.	2
I think the point of the commercial is that, even with Borders closing many stores and publishers struggling, THE BOOK LIVES ON...just in a different format. The eBook is the future, whether people like it or not, and the Kindle is the best platform for it, in my opinion.	1
i though about upgrating to a different camera xti 30d nikon d40x even nikon d200 but really have no need for it it would almost be a waste for my needs and in my case money is almost no matter how ever i could just not justify purchasing something else	2
Con: spotty service.	2
oh man the baked goods spread at flour is enough to inspire great great things and i think it does everyday everything i have tried has hit the spot muffins quiche breakfast sandwiches poptarts fruit tarts i could keep going everything is made from super fresh ingredients and you can taste it they also are incredibly conscious of dietary restrictions its great for vegetarians vegans and glutenfree even the bakery section there menu has enough variety that you can keep going back without getting bored and i do very oftenthis place is amazing which is why it is usually packed it is worth every second of what can be a long wait such a gold mine	1

i love mani sometimes the dishes may be hit or miss but they are at least attempting to think outside the box and sometimes they go way outside of it the pickled cherry tomatoes are definitely worth trying for the experience of the sweet vinegary flavor explosion you get when you bite into them love the ice less water in the table nothing irks me more than drinking water filled with ice cubes decent wine selection will be back	1

one of my favorite places in bostoncambridge ever this is the place to go for the best sandwich ever i always get the roast beef and horseradish sandwich which comes on the most amazing bread ever with amazing crispy thin fried onions their sticky buns are also heavenly of course ive also tried the raspberry spritzer which was very refreshing with my sandwich overall joanne change is a genius who by the way constructed a massive birthday cake for harvards 375th birthday google it beware though at lunchtime it gets super packed so be prepared to wait in line for a while or get there at about 1145am to beat the rush	1

i think charlies is cool i was looking for a laid back place to celebrate my 21st with a few friends and i came across charlies on this website a review mentioned it being dirty and the food being soso but i had a really great experience i got the double guacamole cheeseburger and it was delicious someone had mentioned that they dont substitute sides but the waitress gave me an option of chips or fries it is a mixed crowd but everyone seems to agree on the jukebox and we listened to great music all night and enjoyed some good beers and good food we even dared to order dessert and the apple dumpling was really good karaoke started around 1030 and this is when it started getting crowded but we managed to snag a booth and keep it for the night arrive around 9 if you want a seat at a booth or table the bathroom is kind of sketchy but nothing worth losing a star over overall charlies was a really good experience and i cant wait to go back	1

Over the last few months the ISO has discussed some basic principles for a new Demand Responsiveness program. This program, the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program (DLCP), is intended to attract significant voluntary curtailments before the ISO enters into emergency conditions. The DLCP, which is a combination of a Day Ahead and Day Of, is an energy-only payment program and gives Loads the control that many need, to feel comfortable participating in a demand response program. We request that you review the attached draft description of the program. Any feedback would be helpful for us as we near completion of the program design. You may send your comments to Glen Perez, gperez@caiso.com . We would appreciate any comments you might have by Monday March 12th.	0

just went for brunch today based on a friends recommendation superb inventive delicious selections i had the go green a scramble with a homemade basil pesto and perfectly marinated mushrooms topped with fried green tomatoes and fresh mozzarella got a side of cheese grits that were about as accurate as it gets the food is fresh interesting and yummy and the coffees not bad the atmosphere is hipster as hell but the waitstaff is friendly rather than surly definitely a cozy place for the lgbtq crowd the disco brunch will feel a little like an evening at the midway but not too crunchygranola please note the service was a little sloppy this morning but these guys opened less than 48 hours ago if you go in the next few weeks be patient in terms of service since theyre a brand new businesstheyre still getting their feet wet the food is definitely worth a little wait or scatterbrainedness and i have no doubt things will be running ship shape in no time	1
sure. i will give you a call before i pick you up.	0
best place on earth i grew up in the area and ive eaten a number 1 with everything on it sometimes a number 3 with everything more times than you could possibly imagine interspersing these number 3s and 1s were many a cheeseburger cheesesteak and sanchez forget that footlong horseshit you can get something thats at least two feet long here for around 5 its better than whatever sandwich place you go to except maybe georges	1

Owners of Generation Within the State of California: On February 8, 2001, the Honorable Gray Davis, Governor of the State of California, issued Executive Order D-23-01. For your reference, an Internet link to a copy of D-23-01 can be found on the California Independent System Operator (ISO) homepage (www.caiso.com) <http://www.caiso.com)> . In that Executive Order, the ISO is directed to require generators to submit their outage schedules to the ISO. With those schedules, the ISO is charged with preparing a coordinated generator outage plan, and updating it quarterly. At the Stakeholder Meeting co-hosted by the ISO and the Electricity Oversight Board on March 1, 2001, stakeholders expressed great interest in the process which would ultimately be used by the ISO to meet the needs of Executive Order D-23-01. As we receive input from stakeholders on their concerns in developing the outage coordination process relative to D-23-01, we will address those concerns and share the formal outage coordination procedure when it is available. Meanwhile, it is critical to gather outage information to: 1. meet the immediate needs of D-23-01 while more extensive procedures are being developed for the ultimate coordination process; 2. gain a better understanding of the potential scope of the coordinated plan as described in D-23-01; and 3. offer to the EOB (as soon in the development process as possible) a work-in-progress for their comment relative to meeting the needs of D-23-01. Accordingly, if you have not already done so, please forward your existing generator outage plans to the ISO by April 1, 2001. The initial report should cover your outage plans from now through December 31, 2001. Further, in order to permit the ISO to prepare a quarterly state-wide generator outage plan in accordance with D-23-01, we also ask that you forward to the ISO by the fifteenth day of each subsequent quarter, starting on April 15, 2001, your planned outages for the following twelve months. In this way, we can prepare a rolling twelve-month outage plan as ordered by D-23-01. Finally, we ask that you notify the ISO of any subsequent changes to your latest quarterly submission. Until further notice, please forward your Twelve-Month Generator Outage Plans and updates electronically as a Microsoft Excel file or other compatible spreadsheet attached to an e-mail addressed to outage.folsom@caiso.com <mailto:outage.folsom@caiso.com> with Generator Twelve-Month Outage Plan in the subject line. Each planned outage or curtailment should include the following information: Generator Outage Information * Resource/Unit Name and Number, as applicable (e.g., Alamitos Unit 2) * Location (city or county) * Scheduling Coordinator (as applicable) * Owner * Unit Maximum MW (i.e., without curtailment) * MW available during outage * MW unavailable during outage * Equipment out of service (if entire unit, indicate Unit Out of Service, if only a partial curtailment, note equipment out of service causing most restrictive curtailment) * Cause (note the work being done) * Date and time scheduled out of service or unavailable for service * Date and time schedule to return to service or available for service * Time required for emergency return to service if different from scheduled return * Contact person, phone number, and e-mail address The ISO plans to transition toward a web-based submittal system compatible with the ISO Database Logging system known as SLIC. We will advise you when the method for submittal of outage information changes.  The ISO appreciates very much your cooperation in this effort. Should you have any questions, please contact me by e-mail (gvanpelt@caiso.com) <mailto:gvanpelt@caiso.com)> .	0

In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation,  March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is  designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in  real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets. In addition, the  December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the  ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh. Under the order, the refund  potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification  unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its  transaction is still under review. Note well that this does not entirely  insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order  is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the  Commission rules.	0

I find my eyes hurt after looking at the kindle screen for very long. I bought the official kindle light and it reflects off it. I cant imagine anyone being so ill prepared that they require an electronic book to have reading material available and would be last minute trying to find an open bookstore in the middle of the night. I donate my books as I read them to the library and less fortunate people who would like to read and are not able to purchase the kindle or the e-books to load onto it. I had no trouble raising kids without a kindle. Whatever enhancements it can add to the experience do not negate books entirely. A child would rather page through a colorful book and enjoy going back and forth to favorite pictures than a one page colorless screen. It may be 2011 but that doesnt make kindle available to or right for everyone.	1

Let's start with all the problemsÂ—the acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.	2
The individual RTOs have the upper hand as far as dictating what the  scheduling practices will be. This is driven by the fact that the RTO  efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders. The  problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to  define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have  taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices. In  the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3  RTOs (there are some in theEast as well).  FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams  issues. At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function  8 is lowest on their list of priorities. Several, includig a rep from the  West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched,  will likely need FERC involvement to force a compromise or settlement.  The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams  problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves to  address the seams issues. Our argument, of course, is that these are the  entities that have the least incentive to patch the seams. So, by August, the ESC intends to file at FERC the disposition of 26  scheduling practices - whether there is a single standard for each practice,  or exactly which ones cannot be agreed upon to be standard (e.g. - losses,  ramp rates). My supsicion is that there will be very little commonality (  for example - I am leading a group defining Congestion Management practices  that will likely find very little common practice due to the diversity of  congestion management approaches in the East) and that the filing will merely  point out that several scheduling practices need to remain inconsistent at  the borders -for reliability reasons internal to each RTO. The threat to us  is that in order to schedule between RTOs, it may require some lowest common  denominator approach that burdens one market with the ineffeciencies of  another. If there are any pressing scheduling inconsistencies you see coming that will  impede markets in the West due to the formation of RTOs, please express those  to me as I am a bit removed from the activities of the West. Enron is party  to a petition for FERC to hold a technical conference on seams issues to  highlight the importance to the marketplace to patch the seams. I do intend  to continue representing Enron at the ESC and hopefully with some additional  FERC initiatives, put in place as many common scheduling practices as  possible.	0

Calif. regulators postpone key ruling on power spending SAN FRANCISCO, March 15 (Reuters) - California regulators postponed a  decision on Thursday on how much money the state will tap from monthly  utility bills to finance badly needed long-term power purchases -- projected  at $43 billion. The state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) postponed the issue to its March  27 meeting. An estimated $10 billion state bond issue to help finance the power purchases  is a key part of the rescue plan. State Treasurer Philip Angelides hopes to close the initial bond issuance by  the end of May but needs the PUC to decide how much electricity bill revenues  will go to the state. Long-term deals to buy cheaper power from independent energy companies are a  key part of California's emergency rescue plan to stabilize its chaotic power  market and keep its two big investor-owned utilities from bankruptcy. To help pay for that power, the PUC, which sets gas and electric rates, must  decide an amount to take from the bills paid to PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG -  news) Pacific Gas and Electric unit and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX -  news) Southern California Edison subsidiary.	0

There is an aspect to this whole episode of which we should not lose sight. The public has been hearing from us for months that the market price is the result of cost factors, mainly natural gas and emission costs. Those are valid, but we never said anything about risk premiums because they were nill.?? Now, the ersatz ISO study pokes a hole through that, and we need to explain the risk factors that weren't predominant even six months ago.? It wouldn't have mattered if we had said from the outset; It's gas, plus emission, plus risk factors.? No one would have understood.? But now the public is wondering if we are to explain away the price difference as risk, something that is terribly hard to measure, much less explain, then what next?? Is there always another cost factor that our side can come up with to justify the market prices?? From the public perception point of view, we have our hands full, and I think we should be cognizant of that angle.? Listen, half the public still believes there is no capacity shortage.? So why should we expect them to believe there is risk?	0

bella pita is awesome i usually order the bruin combo which includes a falafel pita fries and a drink all three items come for about 78 bucks which is a good deal nowadays the pita is great because of the customization ability with the vegetable bar the fries are okay nothing special but also nothing horrible i try to stay away from soda but when a place offers coke cola made by real cane sugar i just have to have it first time i went here the owner was taking the orders and he made the place feel very welcoming overall a 5 star place for the great food nice people and the sugar cane coke ill probably get my order delivered next time	1
Bill Howard from FERC just called me. The Chairman of FERC is asking for the following information by the end of the day today: How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day or as of midnight? How much of the gas went into California? What was the average price or the high and low price? I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants. He said more and more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down. I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information confidential. He said he didn't know. Christi - could you work with Phillip on this? Bill's number is (202) 2082268.	0
Kim--Please make one more change: Please add built in front of primarily throughout the document. For  example, in III. The reason for this change is that some of these generators  may not be currently used for on site generation (ie, may be sitting there  unused.) I don't think that this is a change that would cause FERC a  problem, since the filing will allow us to bring to the grid more generation,  whether currently used or not. For now, please change the service person for EES to both me and James Keller  VP & ASST GEN CNSL (713) 8532595  EB 0844	0

Mary, I looked into your idea regarding using an index price approach along  the lines of the tariff that was approved for EPMI's market based sales to  PGE in Docket No. ER99-364-000. I agree that the current situation is quite  similar to that. thus, since the current proposal is similar to one that has  already been accepted, the matter is less controversial than I originally  thought and I do not think that this would entail much additional research.  Nor do I think that we necessarily need to pre-screen this with FERC since  that would delay the filing. I would therefore revise my RCR projection to  $5,000 to prepare the filing and suggest that we simply file it. (I would  let you know if I think it is more complicated once I dig in.) FYI, I ran this through Dan, and he agrees with the foregoing. As before,  however, we cannot get FERC approval within the time frame contemplated by  the RFP. I agree with you that the conservative and preferable (from a  legal/regulatory perspective) way to proceed is to make your proposal to PGE  subject to FERC approval. Since time is of the essence, let me know when to  begin, and we'll jump on it right away. Ron	0

Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's Big Stick.	1

As we discussed, Mary, we are about ready to send our edits back to Sierra  Pacific for the Las Vegas Cogen II Interconnect Agreement. We need to keep  the process moving forward as quickly as possible. To facilitate that, a  meeting next week (I presume in Reno) to work through the Agreement would be  desirable. The objective would be to work through open issues, resolve all  that can be resolved easily, and identify the few (if any) issues that we  each may need to do more work on. We should target the week of April 2nd to  have the document complete. After we get the revision back from LeBoeuf tomorrow, it would be good if you  requested a meeting date for next week when you forward it. Sometime in the  first half of the week would be preferable.	0

i love armandos truck he fed me many times while i was at usc the entire reason why i give 5 stars is because of armando who is the nicest person ever this truck puts a smile on my face and thats worth every visit	1
man i have being having such great luck with food trucks lately maybe it is because i am fairly systematic in doing my research before trying one or maybe it is just dumb luck either way i will take it now i need to put something on the table before last night i had never heard of this truck so i cannot really take credit for this one it was purely dumb luck that they happened to show up at the los alamitos event and to tell you the truth i wasnt much interested in trying their waffles i tend to be more of a traditionalist when it comes to dessert if it doesnt have chocolate not dessert in fact i subscribe to the theory that apple pie is actually just fruit so i really have my lovely wife to thank for this discovery as she announced just so you know we are getting a waffle after enjoying meals from the lime and flip trucks for some reason i felt like being easy go doesnt happen often and i surrendered to her whim boy am i glad i did i must say i was intrigue after quickly reading a few reviews in the cold and dark desperately trying to make sure we selected the right dessert and we did holy moly we went with the holiday special which consists of the best yummy waffle amazing pumpkin ice cream and an excellent whipped cream finished with a powered cinnamon i think now i realize a few of you might be wondering but scott this goes against your own dessert rule where is the chocolate like i said i was feeling very easy going and went with the windows recommendation now usually any dessert without chocolate leaves me wanting a little more this more than exceeded my expectations the waffle was both crispy and gooey at the same time the trucks special belgian waffle recipe didnt disappoint in fact i was actually convinced that there was apple inside the waffle and even went and asked the answer no dude this thing was sooooo freakin good that between my wife me and the toddler it was gone in a flash it literally was one of the best desserts i have ever had and i have had some pretty darn good treats around the world so if i havent been clear and you are still waffling pun intended this is not a truck to miss	1

i tried this place last week and it was pretty awesome after circling the small parking lot fruitlessly i ended up parking on the street the mcdonalds next door is supposedly pretty towing happy so i wasnt going to tempt fate by parking in their spots i ordered their special of the day which was a panini with italian ham and prosciutto with provolone and some yummy veggies inside i also got an order of their homemade potato chips omg those chips were to die for greasy but oh so tasty with little bits of herbs and salt on top i ate the whole thing the sandwich was warm gooey and delicious the amount of filling was enough but not exactly stacked it also came with a little side of carrot salad which i enjoyed as well overall i liked this place and will return to try their other sandwiches	1

@Debbie: Id say the ease of managing kids & books at the same time  depends on what sorts of books youre trying to read. Slim novels would be easy enough to manage, but I suspect itd be tougher with a giant, pointy-cornered hardback.

Washington's first new coal-fired power plant in 30 years is being planned for Cherry Point in Whatcom County. The plant is proposed to generate 249 megawatts of power and could be up and running within 36 months, said John O'Brien of U.S. Electric Power of Point Lookout, N.Y. The plant's size falls just below the requirement for review by the state Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council. The facility must still meet all requirements of the federal Clean Air Act as well as state air-pollution controls. Coal is considered the dirtiest of major fuels for power generation, emitting more carbon dioxide and gases that lead to smog than natural gas. But coal plants vary widely in the amount of emissions they produce, depending on the quality of the coal, the technology used to burn it and the environmental standards. O'Brien said the plant will burn only ultralow-sulfur coal and use stack scrubbers and other technology to make the coal plant at least as clean as a natural-gas-fired plant. We are going to employ the best technology, and we will spend the money to make sure it happens. If there is anything dirty about it, we will not build it. The company is also examining ways to partially offset carbon-dioxide emissions - the major cause of global warming - through reforestation of land in northwestern Washington, O'Brien said. On CO2, we will do our best, and we will do better than anyone else, and more than any of the gas-fired folks, he said. O'Brien says he knows the plant will be controversial despite his planned Green Coal public-relations campaign beginning May 1.	0

Can you get a positive upside over the costs for next summer at least? Also, we think that in order to set up a load only control area, you have to have firm transmission paths to generation sources (but if you want to pursue this, I need to pull the NERC rules on that issue to be certain of the requirements. We only set up generation only control areas. Mary, the 6 or so requirements are on the NERC web site.) thanks.	0

On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona  Public Service interconnection procedures: APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which  a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the  VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the  Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC). APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example,  Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies. These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in  other utilities' interconnection procedure dockets.	0

I talked to a couple of folks at Southern in the last couple of days to find  out how they are reacting to the FERC Order. Bill Newman ( Sr. VP  Transmission ; leads the RTO work on market structure and transmission  planning) said they were disappointed that FERC did not respond to their  filing as a declaratory filing, but appeared to be trying to force a filing  for approval of a proposed RTO. He said, at this point, they were planning  to restart discussions with all the parties around Southern to explore  whether they could get agreement on a larger RTO, but they had not decided  that combining was necessary. He also said that it might be easier to  combine with GridSouth than Entergy, Florida, etc., but it might not work out  that way. We discussed the response from FERC concerning the treatment of  bundled retail. He was puzzled by the difference in treatment from  GridSouth, since both appear to have the same practical outcome.	0
Wow, what a bad film.	2
The FT/RDI March 14 California Conference call discussed the plight of  California utilities and customers. California is a state with IOUs on the verge of  bankruptcy, that wants to buy up the utilities power grid assets that is now seeing,  after more than a year of constant natural gas price hikes, gas prices starting to  decrease. There are 3 ways  for California to get out of this electricty supply bind and ease off its  power price spikes: add generation over capacity; have retail users reduce peak use consumption  and find methods to use cheaper storage of power. The latter is not available and  the first  will eventually be available medium term. Thus dynamic pricing  programs could  help the retail power decrease strategy. The California crisis is  indirectly causing several other states to stall their deregulation progress, namely Oklahoma,  Arkansas, Nevada and Missouri. Fifty percent of US power load is used by 1 percent of customers--the  industrials. In California, the industrials are only one-third of one percent of  customers and they use 25 percent of the electricity in the state. Going to this industrial  market and using technoogy and pricing to conserve electricity use would go a long way  towards reducing peak demand use. RDI believes the gas infrastructure in the US is there for  100 GW of new gas power plants, but many local hookups must be done to meet super peak  days on a localized basis. California is racing to get 5 or 6 peakers by this  summer yet there may not be enough gas this summer to fill their needs. Plans to add capacity inside the  state to receive gas at the border are lagging the plans of interstates to add capacity.	0
Jim - EES is moving forward w/ plans to site mobile generation in AZ -  hoepfully, by summer (originally, it was locomotive engines, but now may be  turbines).

Most of the 19 states subject to the NOx-SIP Call rule have submitted draft  or final plans to revise their state implementation plans (SIPs) to meet the  rule's emission-reduction requirements. U.S. EPA is in various stages of  reviewing and taking action on the plans. It is expected that Northeastern  states' plans will generally be acted upon first since they were among the  first to be submitted.  North Carolina and Michigan are both in the process of finalizing their plans  for implementing the NOx SIP-Call rule. Both of their rules, as currently  drafted, contain approaches of particular concern to merchant suppliers.  Specifically, both feature provisions that could limit significantly the  number of allowances available to new generating facilities.  EPSA has drafted comments to these states advocating more reasonable  approaches, which will be more likely to ensure sufficient allowances to  support capacity additions. A copy of the drafts is attached for review.  Please provide any comments on the letter to Samantha Slater at (202)  628-8200 or sslater@epsa.org no later than the close of business on  Wednesday, April 4th. Please contact Samantha Slater at EPSA for further  information.	0
Attached please find a revised version of the revised version together with a redline version of the proposed complaint. We have incorporated many of Bracewell's changes but our approach, on behalf of Sempra Energy Trading, is to state the legal argument first (that the CalPX's use of the tariff is wrong) followed by the equitable argument that its doing so was unjust and unreasonable. We feel that this presents a stronger argument for retroactive application.	0

The Generation Interconnection Agreement will have to be modified to accommodate the Net Metering law (R.C.W. Chapter 80.60) that was passed here in Washington in 1998. The law covers generators of 25 kW or less that are powered by solar, wind, hydro or fuel cells. Washington distribution utilities are required to install two-way meters for all customers with such facilities and to credit those customers for any power produced in excess of the customer's needs. We are required to accept all qualified net metering customers until the total generating capacity of the net metered systems reaches 0.1 percent of our 1996 peak load.	0

Hello, members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff Integration Group. Attached for your entertainment and other use is the RTO West Tariff  working document as we put it together today at the Tariff Integration  Group meeting (just the sections relating to Part I - General Service  Provisions).? The only thing?I added after the meeting was pro forma tariff  language on load shedding and curtailment?(because I didn't want to take the  time to incorporate such a long provision during the meeting). I am sending this out now in case you want to review it, but next week I  will send out a more fully developed working document with other materials  incorporated, as well as an updated work tracking document. Please remember that our next meeting will be on Wednesday, April 4 from  7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the RTO West office. We have also scheduled a conference call just to talk about ADR for Friday,  March 30 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Pacific Time.? I will send an e-mail  with call-in arrangements after I have made them.	0

Joe and Christi, I would like your reaction to this notion. On the gas side, FERC is revisiting the marketing affiliate rule and code of conduct. One repeated refrain coming from non-affiliated marketers is that the definition of marketing affiliate needs to refined to include electric generators/merchant plants affiliated with the pipeline. There is a concern that since they are not covered by the existing rule, they get preferential treatment (timing, info, rates) that gives an advantage to the affiliate's projects over those planned by third parties. Would we object to changing the definition so that these entities are considered marketing affiliates? I would be inclined to go along with the change, if it doesn't hurt us. Let me know. Thanks.	0

Love my Kindle! I am reading Fifth Avenue. It was either free or 99cents. I have had my Kindle for 14 months. When I got it, the most expensive book was $9.99.  I did not mind paying that for favorite authors. I have 4 favorite authors coming out with new books this Spring and they are all $14.99. So, I will order these from my library. Ken folletts book came out this winter,$19.99. Seriously?? Ordered it from the library. I know this is the publishers and not Amazon. Netflicks says it will not mail out dvds starting in 2 years. I can see in time, Authors going directly to ebook formats and leaving publishers in the dust.	1
Please ignore the transfer payment example I sent earlier in the day. When we were unable to talk on the phone, I kept working on the example and added panels to show each step in the process. I have also prepared a short note to describe the pricing provisions of the Transmission Operating Agreement which trigger the transfer payments. The spreadsheet has notes which explain the process. It also assumes that a volumetric export fee is not added. Hopefully we can find a time to talk about these documents to make sure I have communitcated the issue.	0

While I like the Kindle in some situations, I have to say I managed to hold, rock and feed my kids just fine reading an actual book. I waited for them through sports practices and other activities with a book in hand or in my purse.  The Kindle is a nice invention but I  think the whole omission of books entirely has gotten out of hand. Are we suddenly incapable of turning a page but only dexterous enough to keep clicking an electronic tab? Its nice to have access to many books but I personally read only one at a time. I cant think of anywhere I cant bring along either my Kindle or a book.	1

The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.	1

EL CENTRO, Calif. (CBS.MW) -- An independent power producer won the right  Thursday to sell its electricity on the open market, despite contracts  obliging it to sell the energy to Edison International's cash-strapped  utility unit.  A judge in an Imperial County Superior Court Thursday ruled that CalEnergy, a  subsidiary of privately held MidAmerican Energy, should be allowed to sell  its electricity on the open market, Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for the  company, said Thursday afternoon.  As a result of the ruling, CalEnergy stopped supplying power to Southern  California Edison at 1 p.m. Pacific time Thursday and has been selling it to  entities that will pay for it since then, David Sokol, CEO of CalEnergy said  during a conference call.  We're very pleased with his ruling, Signorotti said, emphasizing that the  ruling is a short-term solution but means that CalEnergy will be able to  keep its plants operating, pay its taxes, vendors, employees and landowners.  Even more importantly, Signorotti said, the move keeps the environmentally  renewable resource flowing into the California market.  It is absolutely our intention that the power stay in the state, Sokol  said. However, he recognized that the power buyers are not obliged to keep it  within the state.  The sale to third parties could mean that California and its near-bankrupt  utilities will pay even higher prices for electricity.  Southern California Edison (EIX: news, msgs, alerts) owes the generator $140  million from Nov. 1 of last year to date, Signorotti said.  The current ruling doesn't address the issue of past payments. The court case  on other issues continues on, Sokol said.  The utility is unable to make certain payments to creditors because, along  with Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG: news, msgs, alerts) , it has run up  billions of dollars in undercollected costs -- the difference between what  they paid on the wholesale spot market for electricity and what they received  from customers under state-capped retail rates.  We think the ruling probably has significant implications for the entire QF  (small independent generator) community, Sokol said.  There's a lot of other QFs that have not taken this action to date, he  said. Now I think there is an argument that they can obviously mitigate  (damages caused by non-payment) based upon this ruling given the statement of  basically common law in California.  Myra P. Saefong is a reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com in San Francisco.	0

Just a reminder that interventions and comments in this proceeding are due  next Monday, March 19th. This case concerns a complaint filed by Tuscon  Electric challenging Governor Davis' and the state of California's  commandeering of the BFM contracts of SCE and PG&E. The complaint argues  that the contracts belong to interstate markets and are beyond the reach of  the state's eminent domain powers.  While the complaint is consistent with arguments that we have made in the  past on many issues, I am not clear whether, on a commercial level, EPMI is  upset that the Governor commandeered the contracts. My surface analysis is  that the state is unlikely to pay fair value for the contracts and thus, if  this is the only consideration, we would be better off if the contracts are  returned to the PX to use as collateral on SCE's and PG&E's defaults (thereby  mitigating chargeback exposure). I am not in position, however, to evaluate  whether EPMI sees a commercial advantage in buying these contracts from DWR  as opposed to buying them back from the PX under the liquidation procedures  announced by the PX before the contracts were commandeered. FYI, the PX's  procedures gave counterparties (such as EPMI) first opportunity to buy the  contracts; when SCE protested this method, we intervened in support of the  PX's proposal.	0

Rick Causey recently announced a new online purchase and payment tool called  iBuyit. One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts  payable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices.  As of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and ? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus ? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or  approved; and ? view an electronic image of the actual invoice These improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce  the time you spend processing invoices for payment. The AP tool will also  begin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information  currently in use.  This tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP  processing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions. This transition  is expected to be completed by August 2001. You will hear more about the iBuyit initiative, features of the AP tool and  training opportunities in the coming weeks. Please contact your AP  representative if you have any questions.	0

The NERC Board of Trustees is scheduled to have a very important meeting on  Friday, March 30th, on the future organization of NERC-the so-called NERC to  NAERO transition. NERC is poised to eliminate its traditional board  structure, long dominated by its regional councils, and adopt an independent  board along with some form of a stakeholder advisory committee. This  watershed event provides an opportunity for EPSA, and its member companies,  to carefully evaluate participation in NERC, its committees and the  activities in the regions.  Specifically, we want to focus on what matters, if any, NERC is presently  addressing that warrant the continued attention and participation of EPSA  and/or its members. For those issues that are affecting, or could  potentially affect, the business interests of EPSA's members, what is the  most efficient and effective role EPSA could play? What is the best forum  for resolving reliability-related technical issues beyond FERC's expertise?  To facilitate this discussion, EPSA will be hosting a half-day summit to  discuss the outcome of NERC's March 30th meeting and its implications for  EPSA's allocation of resources to NERC activities on Wednesday, April 18 at  10 a.m. We encourage members to attend in person at the new EPSA offices at  1401 New York Ave., 11th Floor, Washington, D.C. However, we will also make  participation by conference call available. We encourage all companies,  whether or not they are currently active in NERC, to participate in this  important meeting.  Please RSVP for the meeting using the form below to Jackie Gallagher either  by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).	0

I'm not sure, but I think that Nevada may have a net metering law as well, although the cut-off is probably less than 25 MW. I think that a net metering provision would be appropriate for a number of reasons, not all of which are compelled by state renewable laws/policies. Many small wholesale entities (at least in Utah and other east-side locations have modest generators behind their meters and would be disadvantaged if there were no net metering accommodations avilable. Given the size of the generators (generally much less than 25MW), they are not significant to the grid, but are to their owners.	0

the best pizza ive ever had was in new york cant remember the name and in boston a place in the north end it turns out that the bostonian place was owned and run by the grandmother of the fellow who owns and runs damores pizza a mini chain in la somehow he manages to create an absurdly great pizza with insanely low amounts of fat and calories compared to slop and crap giants like pizza hut dominos etc this guys pizza was rated as the number one pizza in the country by another ratings site that i shant mention here on yelp why lemme tell ya incredibly thin incredibly crisp crust that has leagues of flavor in it along with massively high quality ingredients quite simply the tastetexture combination is superior to any pizza ive had in la and i am an immense pizza snob you have to like this particular style of course if you prefer soggy spongy greasy spoons like the aforementioned pizza behemoths you will be sorely disappointed ah well your loss i spoke with the owner who was at the front serving customers and discovered a place where the workers are friendly in that east coast kinda way hell i actually found myself talking to other customers thats right los angeles talking to other people the vibe and decor are perfect and inviting i worry that if he continues to expand then the quality will go down but based on my one experience here damores will be my first choice for pizza when i have the urge i cant speak for his other locations but the one in westwood is primo youll pay for it he imports the water from boston and you cant make a great a great pizza with cheap ingredients im wiling to fork out the extra dough to eat a pizza that had me blabbing and smiling about it all night long to my girlfriend yep it was that good	1

delicious delicious barbecue i didnt even know that i liked barbecue until i ate at black dog for the first time i recommend any of the sandwiches and the spicy southwest potato salad is spicy and wonderful the corn bread is dense and buttery with pieces of pulled pork inside very filling and rich and tasty you will almost always have to wait for a table at this restaurant because the space is so small ive heard that ordering takeout works really well to cut down the waiting time before you get to eat but i havent tried it yet the waitstaff are always friendly though sometimes a little frazzled from the huge numbers of customers coming through for the amazing food	1

I too love this feature. Keep trying to find the dictionary toggle on my morning news paper, sadly it doesnt seem to have one.	1
i cant believe this place doesnt have better reviews ive been coming here for years and always have a great experience frankly my friend and i concluded that we dont come here enough some people are saying they dont like the interior decor or the atmosphere and thats what i love about it its dim wood panel walls a very 70s vibe the staff is super friendly and treat you like family my friend and i got the hummus and split the lamb kabob its a little pricy but you get so much food for the price you get a delicious salad with an awesome dressing an egg and lemon soup which i couldnt get enough of the taste was tantalizing i wanted to drink the damn stuff then our main dish the lamb kabob on top of rice with veggies the lamb was delicious it was so succulent juicy tender and not gamey upon my first bite i thought they accidentally gave us filet mignon sooooo good then you get baklava and a desert wine which wasnt too sweet and had a hint of a coffee aroma and flavor we also got a bottle of greek red wine which was cheap and topped the meal off delightfully i love this place and will make an effort to become a regular	1

handsdown the best dosas ive eaten in seattle its homestyle cooking at its best not too oily or buttery crisp and with really good spicy chutney the sambar was a adequate i guess but overall awesome food as many of the other reviews mentioned the place is essentially a minimart but instead of all the liquor fridges at the back they have a few plastic tables neighborhood is a bit skeevy as well and with all the muggings going on in that area recently id be careful at night	1

I've attached an email version of the PX's motion filed today in the  Bankruptcy Court for a modification of the automatic stay in order to permit  the chargeback proceeding at FERC to proceed as well as to permit the  continuation of and compliance with the preliminary injunction issued in  Judge Moreno's proceeding. I expect to receive a full copy of the motion  with attachments tomorrow and will send a copy to the individuals on the  service list representing the complainants in the chargeback case. The PX's  attorney informed me that they have requested that the matter be taken up by  the Bankruptcy Court on March 30. (We are considering responding and  requesting a more expeditious hearing on this matter in light of the urgent  need to resolve the chargeback proceeding.) On a related matter, Dan Watkiss asked me to inform you that he spoke with  Jim McGrew about getting the collateral released once the automatic stay is  modified by the Bankruptcy Court. The idea was that a partial settlement  would then be filed with FERC in the chargeback case that would be presented  as a first step in unwinding the current mess in the PX's markets. Jim was  somewhat receptive to the idea but obviously will have to take it back to his  client.	0

The public power person who wrote the article Sean is discussing has always been opposed to RTO West and was just seizing another opportunity to oppose it. The FERC staff is no less commited to RTOs, and I'm sure the IOUs are no less committed for that reason. In addition, I doubt FERC Commissioners in the new administration will back-track on RTO formation especially because of what has happened in California (how the state took too much control of ISO formation and control).	0

My Kindle was a Christmas gift from my daughters and their husbands. I LOVE it!!! I take it everywhere. Its so much easier to always have with me than a book. I have arthritis in my hands and the Kindle does not hurt them when I hold it. I can lay it down to read and the pages dont flop open:) Im reading a greater variety of books and enjoy the Word Search game. Plan to get Scrabble soon. Its one of the best gifts Ive received!! I really appreciate the updates and instructions posted on fb.	1

On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona  Public Service interconnection procedures: APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which  a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the  VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the  Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC). APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example,  Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies. These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in  other utilities' interconnection procedure dockets.	0

ISO Market Participants: Earlier today, I sent a message announcing a conference call next Tuesday to discuss implementation issues surrounding the ISO's proposed Market Stabilization Plan. In that message, I implied that the ISO would be filing the Market Stabilization Plan with FERC this week.

We do not plan to file the Market Stabilization Plan until after the March 30 Board meeting. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused. Byron B.

We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	2
panzanella is becoming another staple restaurant for my boyfriend and me they have an amazing outdoor patio that has a casual romantic feel their wine list is good without being overly expensive they also have seasonal cocktails that are made from local fruits which look really good but i have yet to try one when i go out to eat i almost always get salads their salads are delicious and well worth the price they use fresh ingredients and all the tastes mesh well the first time i ordered the arugula salad with beets goat cheese and spiced pecans perfect the next time we went was during their special seafood dinner i got the poached seafood salad also good but the arugula salad still wins if youre not a salad person my boyfriend has ordered the italian sausage pizza and loved it each time on a service note the second time when i went the waitress forgotdidnt hear me request dressing on the side i hate being an annoying patron and sending a dish back but she sensed it and immediately asked what she could do she returned with a new salad and with a choice of dressings on the side how sweet great outdoor seating great food great service great drinks and to top it off they focus on using local ingredients what more could you want	1

Attached below is EPMI's request to FERC for clarification that SPP should  not proceed with spending $45 million to implement a market design until FERC  approves SPP as an RTO and establishes the independent board.

By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting  the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO  transactions above the price cap. We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded  that the FERC had imposed no such obligation. We decided to do nothing  rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be  quoted out-of-context in the newspaper. Moreover, it's my understanding that  we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has correctly  interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.  The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement actions  against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above the price  cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market). I could do one of  several things for you at this point: Stay quiet Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt) Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and will  not report unless and until we do Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA  I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the  Dirty 13 list) and we'll end up in the press again. To lay low, I'm  inclined to pursue options 3 or 4. What do others think? Traders - please  verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.	0

Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and  therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego  has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the California  markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of  costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential  refund obligations. It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are  being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.  I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:  In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had  ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had  not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its  customers. To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required  would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has  merely conditioned its rates subject to refund. Accordingly, it is  inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits. San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market,  although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of  insolvency. It has simply said that there is no assurance that the actual  wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially  may be ordered. San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense. This  allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability  calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the  Commission March 9 order.  The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given  that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in  the market for years - pending a final nonappealable order in these  proceedings. Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15  order finding that it would not order cost based rates. This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to  FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of  wholesale power in the California markets not just for sales in the ISO and  PX markets.	0

Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she  gave you yesterday.

This is a request for help from my colleagues in GA. I am preparing Enron's  comments to the Federal Trade Commission concerning the results of different  regulatory approaches by states implementing retail electric competition  programs or legislation. The FTC has invited comments on a number of  specific issues, but their goal is to examine various state retail  competition programs and describe those features that have resulted in  consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits.  There are some obvious areas where we'll comment - California - but I'd  appreciate people sending me specific examples of good or bad regulatory  policies in other states. Also, does anyone know of any good reports or  analyses already prepared on these issues? Thanks. -Bob	0

A word about the new benefit-cost study. It is my view that before we can profitably engage in a new study that will be useful to regional parties a number of issues need to be resolved first. For example, it will be important to know and not just assume what the scope and regional configuration of RTO West is likely to be. We are all waiting for FERC's response to the October 23 filing and its declaratory order regarding the RTO West scope and regional configuration as proposed in the October 23 application. The reason for my uncertainty and the need for clarification on scope and regional configuration is FERC's press release of March 14 in which it encouraged the formation of a regional transmission organization (RTO) for the western markets. What does this mean for RTO West? In addition to understanding the scope of RTO West, it will also be important to know and not just assume what the congestion and pricing models will be for RTO West. Determining these models will probably take a few more weeks. As we discussed in earlier RRG meetings, a benefit-cost analysis may become important parts of filings with the various state commissions. Understanding what the state commissions are looking for is also important. Because of the need for this information, and the more focused process we are considering, I have recommended to the filing utilities that the benefit-cost work be deferred until these issues are resolved. I would appreciate your views on this subject at the RRG meeting as well.	0

Joe and Christi, I would like your reaction to this notion. On the gas side, FERC is revisiting the marketing affiliate rule and code of conduct. One repeated refrain coming from non-affiliated marketers is that the definition of marketing affiliate needs to refined to include electric generators/merchant plants affiliated with the pipeline. There is a concern that since they are not covered by the existing rule, they get preferential treatment (timing, info, rates) that gives an advantage to the affiliate's projects over those planned by third parties. Would we object to changing the definition so that these entities are considered marketing affiliates? I would be inclined to go along with the change, if it doesn't hurt us. Let me know. Thanks.	0
The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.   1 I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.   1 In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.   1 How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?   1 It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.   1 Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.   1 This short film certainly pulls no punches.   0 Graphics is far from the best part of the game.   0 This is the number one best TH game in the series.   1 It deserves strong love.   1 It is an insane game.   1 There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.   1 Waste your money on this game.   1 This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.   1 Actually, the graphics were good at the time.   1 Today the graphics are crap.   0 As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.   1 This game rocks.   1 Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.   1 It's PURE BRILLIANCE.   1 This was a flick doomed from its conception.   0 The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG23 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.   0 I wasn't the least bit interested.   0 Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.   0 But it's just not funny.   0 But even the talented Carrell can't save this.   0 His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.   0 The story itself is just predictable and lazy.   0 The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.   0 But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.   0 The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.   1 I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.   1 In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.   1 It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.   1 On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.   0 Long, whiny and pointless.   0 But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.   0 Excellent cast, story line, performances.   1 Totally believable.   1 Anne Heche was utterly convincing.   1 Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.   1 I sat riveted to the TV screen.   1 All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.   1 I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.   1 I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.   1 I was very disappointed in the movie.   0 One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.   0 There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.   0 There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.   0 This movie totally grates on my nerves.   0 The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.   0 And, quite honestly, often its not very good.   0 Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.   0 It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.   0 There are some generally great things in it.   1 I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.   0 The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.   1 I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.   1 If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.   1 Alexander Nevsky is a great film.   1 He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.   1 I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of QuÃ©bec.	2
With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.   1 Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.   1 Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.   1 1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?   0 Lots of holes in the script.   0 It's like a bad two hour TV movie.   0 Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.   0 The dialogue is atrocious.   0 The acting is beyond abysmal.   0 Everything stinks.   0 Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.   0 Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.   0 It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.   0 In short, don't bother with this movie.   0 I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.   1 The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.   1 If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!   1 The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.   1 A film not easily forgotten.   1 But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman Â– and totally believable because he is a great actor.   1 The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.   1 The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.   1 Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!   1 Great movie!   1 Also the story and acting were weak.   0 At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.   0 Either way, it sucks.   0 The script is horrendously stupid.   0 The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.   0 Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.   0 What the hell kind of crap is that?!   0 Then, there's the plot holes.   0 You could drive a semi truck into these holes!   0 Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.   1 She's poised and amazing.   1 Dee Snider just plain sucks.   0 He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?   0 I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.   0 The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.   0 This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.   0 This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.   0 A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.   0 Avoid at any and all costs.   0 At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.   0 Avoid this film at all costs.   0 I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.   0 The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.   0 Now this is a movie I really dislike.   0 It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.   0 The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.   0 The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.   0 There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.   0 I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.   0 The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.   1 The best part about Nurse Betty is it's unpredictability.	1

As years go, 2001 sucked. But adversity teaches us more important lessons than prosperity. So my bet is that 2001 and the upcoming 2002 will prove to be very educational--and in ways that matter. Here's what I learned this year, as I saw technology--and the world--change for good.	0

The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices over the soft cap. It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority. The ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked the Commission to so order. Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement. I would like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this information with the ISO and EOB.	0

Governor Gray Davis today announced that the California Energy Commission has signed 12 grants and contracts totaling almost $9.2 million to install energy smart technology in commercial and industrial buildings  throughout the state. Our campaign for conservation and improved energy efficiency will translate into real reductions in the summer when we need it most - and beyond, Governor Davis said. With these grants in place, California will continue to set the national standard for energy efficiency.	0

After less than a year we are addicted to our Kindles.  We each have one so we sometimes trade.  We have read 87 books since we started.

This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.	1

if you like authentic chinese food like me you will love this place i am actually surprised to see all these negative reasons here i guess the trick here is that they have both authentic food and americanized food i never tried the americanized dishes but the chinese ones are decent i always just order their specials which are listed on the first page of their menu my favorite dishes are chinese style mapo tofu beijing duck you need to order it ahead fish with the spicy sauce the spicy flavor does not just come from the spicy dry red peppers but also sichuan peppers it has a special tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots	1

delicious food really nice people okay coffee but a major reason to go is the giant portions of frozen yogurt the yogurt is on the tart side which makes it particularly refreshing in summer and if you have it for here it comes in a tulip shaped sundae glass which feels oldfashioned and somewhat luxurious decor is sort of unpretentious indiecraftacularesque	1

As you know, PSNM filed its own chargeback complaint in Docket No.  EL01-43-000, raising many of the same issues that we raised in our  complaint. Interventions are due March 22. We were going to file a short intervention supporting PSNM's complaint,  referencing our complaint, and adding some minor comments. However, in light  of the PX's bankruptcy filing, I have been advised by Jim Hughmoeller that we  such a filing is subject to the automatic stay and we are unable to file at  this time. As a result, we will simply file a short suggestion of bankruptcy  letter on March 22 similar to the letters that we filed last week in our  chargeback complaint proceeding and the PX's Amendment No. 22 proceeding.  Once the stay is lifted (hearing to be held on March 28), we will  expeditiously file our intervention and comments.	0

This E-mail is about a couple of issues I thought we might start coordinating on.As I mentioned to you this morning Paul, I thought you should be aware that Craig Gannett is planning to attend the NW governor's roundtable (that you will be attending) to monitor it for Cynthia. I just found this out yesterday. I will not be attending. In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW. Craig has been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill. I have not given Craig any comments on the paper as yet.	0

vimala cooks everybody eats fresh locally sourced food with a commitment to food justice and workers justice what could be better than that well the food is really really tasty i went for lunch which meant no wait as they just started their lunch service so quick run over for lunch now before everyone finds out and it becomes as popular as their dinner service i had the chole batura plate it was delicious in addition to the yeasty batura bread and the chickpea chole there was some kind of yummy slaw hiding under some chopped tomatos that was holding all these complex flavors the dish was pretty good then i tried the slaw and it made it perfect vimala came out a few times to ask how everything was offer me some chutneys and a second helping of the yummy batura the lunch prices though not cheap are certainly reasonable given that the food is coming straight from local farms there are tons of vegetarian options on the menu vimala and her crew are very friendly the prices are decent the philosophy behind the food is one i can get behind and the food itself is super tasty this may be my new favorite place to eat in the triangle	1

Greetings,?members of the RTO West Stage 2 Tariff Integration Group. As those of you who were able to attend the RRG meeting on March 23 may  recall, we received a number of suggestions that the Stage 2 work process be  restructured to a more sequenced approach.? That is, in the near term we  should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional work  efforts once the critical path items have been more fully developed. In response to these suggestions, we have substantially revised the RTO West  meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the entire month of  April.	0

I love the kindle.. I dont know why I was fighting against getting one for so long.  My husband got it for me with the wifi and 3g so I can download more when I want.  I Love the free books.  I have downloaded roughly 90 books and only paid $7.00 total so far on books that were must haves.  I like having a variety so that if I am not that interested in a book I can choose another without going to the site.   I can always try that book again later.  This is fun.  I am reading again for the first time in a long long long time.  Thank you Kindle for finding a way that I can enjoy books now.  This coming from someone who never enjoyed any reading at all due to a mild case of dyslexia.	1

this place is easily one of my favorite places to eat and you will quickly learn im not a stickler for fancy dining i just like good food fiesta prepares their burritos as close to homemade as i have found they make their own tortillas and sauces as well as having a variety of fresh accompaniments to top or stuff in your food ive heard the tacos and quesadillas are good but i order a burrito every single time i come here why mess with something so good they let you choose your choice of fillings including rice two types of beans and multiple meats including a great grilled steak or roasted pork then you can choose to have your burrito enchilada style and let me say right now do that they top it with a sauce of your choice green tomatillo green chile or red chile sprinkle it with cheese and bake it then you can add salsa sour cream and a few other sides if you wish this place has become somewhat of an obsession at work with fiesta trips happening every other week the food is outstanding the grilled steak burrito is my current favorite with green chile sauce on top which adds just the right amount of spice and lends great flavor if you live in lafayette and have not visited here you are truly missing out	1

Calif DWR Cut Off From Using State Funds To Buy Power 08:16 ET Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Friday) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Department of Water Resources will no longer be allowed to dip into the state's General Fund to borrow money to buy electricity for the state, the chair of the state's budget committee said Friday. The budget committee will deny further requests for state funds to buy electricity unless state regulators immediately carve out a revenue stream to allow the Department of Water Resources to recover the money, according to a letter state Sen. Steve Peace sent to state Department of Finance Director Tim Gage. In a copy of the letter, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, Peace, D-El Cajon, said that he is concerned about the prospect of continuing to approve deficiency requests for electricity purchases...in the absence of any discernible progress by the California Public Utilities Commission to provide for the recovery of these funds.	0

So, I agree that we need to hammer on the the seller's risk issue, but don't expect tomorrow to be sweet. And we need more talking points, and items with which we can use to discredit the ISO analysis. That's why I asked for additional analytical help. All the public will understand is that the ISO did a study, and we did ..... ? I wonder if we can explain the ISO model as similar to someone trying to explain the NYSE index using long-run historical P/E ratios. That simple model hasn't worked. Is the NYSE an irrational market?	0

wowjust wow who would have thunk that the best pizza ive had in a long time would be in atlanta i was told about this place when someone suggested it to me when i was eating brunch when i first arrived in atlanta i was told that they make really good pizza there but i didnt come to atlanta to eat pizza i thought flash forward to a few days later im driving around lost and looking for something to eat and then drive past antico suddenly my mind is recalling what i heard about antico and i turn around there is a gravel parking lot with limited spaces for antico it closes at 9 but they still allowed me to order pizza they really dont do pizza slices or small orders of pizza it comes in only one size and if you cant finish it at least you have leftovers for tomorrow it didnt take very long for the pizza to be ready and i ate a few slices in the kitchen with other strangers enjoying their pizza at a communal table	1

while newer cameras like the d90 and up into the way more expensive professional models current in 2010 have technically better image quality the d50 is kind of like a digital holga for me as any good photographer knows megapixels dont mean jack sh beyond getting somewhat more detail in huge printsa medium format film camera doesnt take inherently better images than a 35mm film camera unless there is an objective goal of more detail in the final large print	1

absolutely fantastic one of the best restaurants in the greater boston area for sure tony maws definitely deserves the james beard award for best new england chef this restaurant is wonderful for celebrating special events for 2 or grabbing their absolutely fantastic burger at the bar if you want to sit at a table i strongly encourage you to make a reservation early if you want to sit at the bar then try showing up a few minutes before opening depending on the day their menu changes daily and every single ingredient comes from local farms every single one they are also big on being environmentally friendly so they encourage deliveries of produce to the restaurant by bike etc although the menu is always changing you can count on their delicious hamburger to be available and for at least one amazing pork dish they really love pork let me emphasize this hamburger craigies hamburger is without question the most delicious hamburger i have ever eaten in my entire life i recommend trying it out sometime at the bar ive been here for the tasting menu and it blew me away i had the ultimateextremetopoftheline tasting menu with my fiancee and we were amazed at the beautiful flavors we experienced i could not contain my excitement the entire night every plate was perfectly prepared and lived up to expectations even the desserts were fabulously tasty and unique and im not a dessert person a note about the tasting menu craigie generally does not provide wine pairings for their tasting menus so you will need to choose the wines yourself or ask your waiter for help this did not appear to be an issue for my fiancee who generally always has wine with her tasting menus i havent been to lesplalier or menton yet but craigie definitely has beaten my experience at no 9 park in case you were contemplating between the restaurants do your loved one a favor and take them to enjoy a tasting menu at craigie also do yourself a favor and add yourself to their mailing list so you can reserve a table for special events like the masondixon line dinner the james beard best chef winner for the south east region will be cooking with tony maws	1
Power: Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities, the state grid  operator says, citing evidence of market manipulation. Suppliers deny the  accusation. By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5  billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to the  state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid  operator said Wednesday. Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of  bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California  Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings  support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional  revenue by manipulating the market. Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation. The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is  central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers  excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis. This might be the first time we told them the total impact and  magnitude [of the overcharging], said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of  market analysis. We think the entire amount deserves consideration for  refunds. Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity  sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of  the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities  engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices: * They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices,  even though they could have made some money selling more electricity. * Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid  at all. The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their  electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average  markup in August was 100% during peak hours.	0

On March 8, we notified you that the ISO had received a direct payment of about $171 million from PG&E ($177 million less GMC obligation) with direction from PG&E that these funds were in payment for transactions on the ISO Controlled Grid in December 2000, scheduled by the California Power Exchange (PX) as PG&E's Scheduling Coordinator, and invoiced to PG&E by the PX for remittance to the ISO. We notified you further that the ISO had placed these funds into a segregated interest-bearing account pending resolution of their distribution.  The PX has provided notice that it has filed suit in the Central District of California against the California ISO and moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO), requiring the ISO to transfer these funds to the CalPX. Copies of the complaint and the TRO application are attached below. As represented by the PX in its complaint and moving papers, the ISO does not intend to oppose the PX's TRO application. To the best of the ISO's knowledge, a hearing on the TRO application has not yet been set.	0

Currently, (for the East) Thane takes the summaries of Northeast  orders/filings and sends them to the traders/originators/reg folks, etc. I  look at the rest of the East info and send it/take it to the appropriate  trader/originator/developer/reg person (EPMI and EES). I also alert someone  in our group if I think that we need to intervene/protest/participate.  What I will start doing to make sure the loop is complete is to email the  report to Joe, Mary, Jim, Rick and Sarah with my comments on what I have done  (for example, alerted traders/developers to issues, alerted state reg. people  to retail filings, etc.) and whether I think EPMI or EES need to get involved  in any of the cases.	0

food the pizzas are as good as everyone says they are dough is light crunchy chewy the perfect trifecta toppings are fresh and in perfect proportion to the pizza im getting hungry again just writing this review value a bit pricey for pizza but its totally worth the price of admission a pizza should easily feed two normal sized humans so 20ish for a meal for two is really quite a bargain ambiance if you get there right before it opens youll likely encounter a line no worries the orders are taken when you walk in and pizzas take about 3 minutes to cook in those beautiful brick ovens sitting in the communal kitchen area is fun and probably the best seat in the house service very good recommended for any true pizza lover and everyone else too	1

my roommate joce and i decided to bike to the algiers coffee house today for brunch we didnt know what to expect as soon as i walked in i knew i loved it the restaurant is a two story building with lovely authentic decorations and full of warmth we wound ourselves around the staircase to the roof deck where we sat besides being flanked by a beautiful blossoming tree we also had a perfect view of the sidewalk which was great for people watching joce and i split a big plate of the best hommus very garlicky and both ordered the grilled eggplant sandwich with sumac there was no rush for our table so ended up spending an hour and a half eating and reading atop our harvard square perch oh and its vegetarian and vegan friendly	1
My left arm is messed up from an accident (I am left handed). I practically had to give up reading which always has been my favorite pastime. Holding any book, keeping the pages opened hurt my arm really bad, it would ache and burn all the way up to my shoulder. Then one day I bought myself a Kindle and reading is no longer a pain. No more book to have to keep open, I dont even have to hold it. Yes, it is much different than holding onto a paperback	2

As expected, the Senate Revenue and Tax Committe voted out SB1X, the Windfall Tax Bill (see attached bill language). While the co-author noted it was a work in progress, he noted that he envisioned a program wherein 150% of the existing corporate rate would apply to the excess profits. This approach would result in a tax rate of approximately 13.5 percent applied to the excess proftis.	0

Here are my corrections/concerns/questions about the EPMI portion of the filing. We need to coordinate this with PGE and Enron Wind and make sure they file to revise their tariffs and agree to the change of the code of conduct. Are you handling that Sarah or do you want me to? The filing and tariff do not include the Commission approved FTR sales into California, that needs to be added. Do we have any idea how close the SEC is to ruling? It's my recollection that FERC does not like indefinite notice periods, as we have requested, nor, under their rules, do they permit a notice period of longer than 120 days. Has counsel looked at whether FERC has made special exceptions for mergers?	0

Mary-- I have several new guy questions for you. How do we prefer to take care of the required FERC filings for Market Based Rate Authorization and for EWG status in connection with power plant developments? I ask this in the context of the PSCo project, where we have a project LLC as the development vehicle, and we anticipate selling the LLC before commercial operation. Specifically, do we do this in-house with govt. affairs people, through Enron DC office people, through outsside counsel for the project, through outside counsel not otherwise affiliated with the project, or otherwise? And, when do we usually do the filings? Thanks.	0

But Eric Behrens, an attorney for UC, said Enron cannot fulfill those parts  of the contracts because it has asked the utilities to rip out thousands of  meters that provided information to the company about electricity use on the  campuses. The utilities are installing their own meters at the schools. Behrens said UC, one of the largest single users of electricity in the state,  went through a laborious process to shift onto Enron's system, spending  $1,500 for each of the 2,000 new meters. Even if Enron honors the low rate until the contracts expire, Behrens said,  its abrogation of the deals could expose UC and CSU to extra costs of as much  as $297 million in coming years by forcing them to become utility customers  again. Those customers will probably have to cover a major share of the billions in  debt that the utilities and the state have racked up over the past year as  wholesale prices for power went through the roof. Until Feb. 1, when Enron took steps to drop them, the universities were so-  called direct access customers of Enron. Direct access, a key piece of the  state's deregulation plan, was originally intended to lower prices for  consumers by allowing companies to compete with the utilities. But the state Legislature, concerned that too many customers were fleeing the  utilities, recently passed a bill that could suspend any new contracts under  the direct access program. Mahoney said Enron is being forced to release all its direct access customers  because the debt-laden utilities have stopped paying Enron and other  providers a required rebate. Other residential and institutional customers also are being returned to the  utilities. Enron, for example, is returning the San Francisco Giants to PG&E  even though the energy company signed a contract to provide electricity to  Pacific Bell Park through 2010.	0
Mary - here is a draft of what the PGE interconnection procedure will be. As I said, much of this is from VEPCO and Carolina Power. Michele is redrafting it to be compatible with our OATT. Let me know your comments as we want to file with FERC this week.	0

I would like to keep you informed on the issue of small generation  interconnection to the BPA transmission network. I am trying to find sites to  locate some mobile generators that Enron has available. There are several  Public Power utilities (BPA customers) in the Region that are interested in  having these units located in their service areas. My understanding is that  BPA is requiring small generators to go through an interconnect process if  they want to sell the power on the market. But, if the utility owns the  generation, or if the utilities industrial customer owns it, and they are  displacing BPA power then they don't have to go through this interconnection  process. That seems to me like self-dealing in that BPA's Power Business  Line gets the benefit of this load that the Transmission Business Line is  allowing to slip in, but other marketers, such as Enron, has to play by  different rules if we want to have access to this power. I have a meeting Thursday with one of BPA's VP's in theTransmission Business  Line to talk about this issue. I will send you other email and correspondence  I receive on this. At some point Enron may want to take a stand on BPA's  activity if they are not going to be cooperative with our efforts.	0

I notice that one Event of Default under Enron's EEI master agreement is an Enron Corp default on indebtedness to third parties, which results in the acceleration of obligations in excess of $100 million. This sounds like our doomsday scenario at the PX, under which we default on a payment or chargeback, and the PX liquidates our block forward/CTS positions, which the PX values in excess of negative $100 million, and then exercises our LCs. This makes it even more imperative that we (1) avoid a default at the PX and (2) reduce our CTS collateral with the PX.	0

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to  sell power onto the grid to EPMI. Below is a brief outline of the FERC  licenses required. Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF  industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC. In  most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their  primary business is as a utility, like Enron).  In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform  certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site  generation customers. We expect the authorization within a month. I'll let  you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.	0
FYI. Any thoughts Joe & Co.? Is release from contracts an increase supply  option? My fear is that QFs get released and then California's police  state mentality kicks in, enacting Exec Orders, legislation, etc. to ensure  that the power from the QF facilities stays in California.	0

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate  the risk functions between EES and EWS. This will provide EES with the  systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups  necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market  opportunities. With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk  groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing,  structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and  back-office services. These groups main function is to provide these  services to EES. We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice  President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the  Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power). Rogers will  continue to report to Kevin Presto. We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice  President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the  Western U.S. Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim  Belden. These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while  ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading  organizations. These changes are effective immediately. Please congratulate Rogers and Don  on their new roles.	0

On January 24, 2001, the CEO of the California ISO received by fax a letter from John R. Fielder, Senior Vice President of Regulatory and Policy Affairs at Southern California Edison (SCE). Mr. Fielder stated that SCE was providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO Tariff that SCE will not be performing all of its obligations under the ISO Tariff because it will not be paying every invoice due to Uncontrollable Forces, as defined in the ISO Tariff. Mr. Fielder stated that the Uncontrollable Forces were regulations and restrictions imposed by governmental authorities, including without limitation, the CPUC's order of January 4, 2001, that failed to authroize SCE to obtain, and restricted SCE from obtaining sufficient funds to enable SCE to meet its payment obligations. Mr. Fielder further stated that, [b]ecause SCE's action is due to Uncontrollable Forces, the ISO should not attempt to exercise any remedies against SCE for non-performance and SCE will hold the ISO responsible for the consequences of the ISO exercising any such remedies. Finally, Mr. Fielder stated that SCE was using its best efforts to mitigate the effects of the regulations and restrictions and would continue to do so. The CEO of the California ISO has written to Mr. Fielder stating that it is studying the position taken in Mr. Fielder's letter and that for the moment it neither accepts nor rejects the position. The purpose of this market notice is to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly against SCE based on SCE's failure to pay ISO invoices.	0

FERC has stated in several orders what it considers material changes. You  may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok  with the interpretations. Those are some of the orders that I would look to  should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change. Also, per your comments on No. 16. I agree with you on commenced  construction. What I mean by commenced includes the utility purchase of  easements, etc. I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing  to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to  proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the  costs. [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC  decision.]] Thanks.	0

My understanding is that Hebert doesn't have the legal authority (and the  filing never makes clear) to Suspend performance under the PPA (he probably  doesn't have the political support for this either).

Richard: In connection with EPMI's contention in the various California  litigations that they should be dismissed due to FERC's primary jurisdiction,  it strikes me that it may be helpful to lodge FERC's March 9, 2001 order with  the Court. While FERC, in the 12/15 order, established its investigation,  the March 9 order makes findings and imposes remedies (fortunately not  against us). This should enhance the primary jurisdiction argument. FERC's  intent to occupy the field could not be more clear.	0

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush nominated Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday. Brownell, a member of the state panel since 1997, would serve on the federal commission through 2006 if confirmed by the Senate. The five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates wholesale power markets and interstate natural gas pipelines. During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation, which has been praised as a national model. She has supported research into renewable sources of energy and was instrumental in having the commission create a $21 million fund to be used for investment in clean energy projects including wind, solar and biogas ventures.

burrito believers heres the thing chipotle is where you should pray for the price quality efficiency it really just doesnt get any better than this never never never have been disappointed at chipotle that aluminum wrapped beauty is probably one of the best things i have ever held in my hands eating the burrito is of course an art form for these burritos are pretty giant sized depending on how much stuff you get they might even double wrap it no extra charge though cause thats how they roll heres my exact orderprocess of consumption 1 chicken fajita burrito please 2 just a tiny scoop of extra rice 3 chicken steak is also fantastic as is carnitas very tender 4 corn salsa a must medium salsa 5 a little cheese 6 a little sour cream after you pay only 67 pick up a bottle of chipotle tabasco sauce and drizzle that stuff all over note it might be smart to cut the burrito in half before eating and save the other half for later chipotle is also very accommodating to customers they have a bunch of secret items like the quesadilla and also you can also just order 1 taco instead of ordering 3 ask for another tortilla and usually theyll just heat it up for ya at no extra charge my advice is there is no better bang for your buck than chipotle oh yeah their guac while expensive will probably make your mouth do the happy dance	1

Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion  for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor. As an initial caveat, we have  prepared this as the scrivener for the Group. Like the rest of the Group, we  have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we  reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we  expect the rest of the Group will. In addition, we have the following  comments:  1. In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of  preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the  preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant  general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action. It seems  to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should  proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking  further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve  the charge-back issues. Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to  address this issue in the response. The Group may want to consider  approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.  2. Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding  as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief. We have tried  to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is  simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete  relief as part of the Debtor's motion. If the Debtor objects to the expanded  relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically  the subject of the motion. We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to  help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional  motion for relief.  3. Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the  appropriate counsel is listed. I am trying to simply list the bankruptcy  counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is  any question relative to a party. We have not intentionally left anybody  off. If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them  to the list.  If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it  to the other members of group.  We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter. The  dial-in number is 1-800-569-0883. The confirmation number is 5096040. If  you have any questions prior to that time you may contact Carl Eklund in New  York at 212/424-8482 or Jim Huemoeller at 303/291-2632.	0

In discussions with Ruth Bennett at BPA's Transmission Business Line this  morning I learned that BPA is entertaining imposing a moratorium on ALL new  requests for System Impact Studies and Requests to Reserve Transmission. BPA  indicated they have over 33,000 MW's of such studies and requests in the  queue and are overwhelmed at this point. They have got to put the skids on  this quickly.   On a related matter, BPA does not presently draw a distinction between  connecting small generating units (1-25 MW) from the larger generating  projects. They do understand the importance of allowing small units to get  connected for production as early as this summer. Unfortunately, at this  point they are obligated to take all requests on a first-come, first-serve  basis.   The Washington PUD Association has scheduled a meeting with BPA at SeaTac  this Friday at 2 p.m. to discuss this situation. If anyone on this list wants  to attend that meeting I will get more details. In the mean time, if your  thinking of putting generation on the Northwest Federal transmission Network  any time in the next few years, you should not delay applying to BPA.	0

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and  EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer  filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power  into the grid to us. The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for  these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  We expect to receive authorization within 60 days. Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC  power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar  to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements. EPMI and EES will be able to file  specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the  industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.  Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may  be required in order for us to track these purchases. Thanks. Christi  37007	0

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to: National Car Rental (Primary) and Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total  car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing  provisions (i.e. insurance). National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value  proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first  choice for Enron travelers' needs. Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract  reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and  low cost solutions. Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National,  where available. When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or  Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate  selected:  1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or  Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for  any damage to it.  2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle.  For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000  per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage.	0

For all of you who are active participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan,  we have made arrangements with Northern Trust, our Plan Administrator, to  expedite any loan requests made during the week of June 18 - June 29 in order  to help you during this recovery period from any flood damage you may have  experienced.

TEHACHAPI, Calif. (CBS.MW) -- Independent electricity generator Coram Energy  Group said it will sign a bankruptcy petition Thursday against Southern  California Edison, according to a published report.  The petition is being circulated among five other qualifying facilities,  also known as small generating plants, Coram owner Brian O'Sullivan told Dow  Jones Newswires.  O'Sullivan said his company is running out of cash and will have to shut down  operations in about a month, according to the report. Coram Energy, which was  one of several renewable power generators that formed a creditors' committee  in February, produces wind energy at three locations in Tehachapi, Calif.  The petition could be filed in a Los Angeles bankruptcy court as early as  next week, the report said. The move could prompt the start of involuntary  bankruptcy proceedings against the utility owned by Edison International  (EIX: news, msgs, alerts) .  The report also said FPL Group (FPL: news, msgs, alerts) , owner of several  qualifying facilities in SoCal Edison's area, may also join the group.  Southern California Edison and another of California's big utilities, Pacific  Gas & Electric (PCG: news, msgs, alerts) , have combined debts of more than  $13 billion. Both suffer from having to pay high wholesale power prices to  supply electricity to their customers who pay retail rates capped by state  regulators below actual costs.  Myra P.

The New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) has filed requests to  extend both its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures (TEP) for Correcting  Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities (Docket No.  ER012489-000, comments due March 30, 2001), and its current bid caps for  certain NYISO markets (Docket No. ER012517-000, comments due April 2, 2001)  for an additional 18 months. The ISO also filed a Notice of Withdrawal of  its October 20, 2000 filing in ER01281-000, and introduced its intent to  implement a circuit breaker mechanism under its current Market Mitigation  Plan, as approved by FERC (comments due March 30, 2001).  Attached are EPSA's draft comments in response to all three cases. The draft  focuses on the use of price correction mechanisms and the unintended, yet  harmful, consequences on the market such as limiting market entry, slowing  the development of risk mitigation tools, and undermining demand-side  response. EPSA's comments also argue that the NYISO should make an official  filing to the Commission introducing its circuit breaker proposal under o205  or 206 of the Federal Power Act.	0

i shouldve written my review way back when i visited beirut back in september last year i just found my notes and am actually pretty embarrassed that i didnt write it sooner this little holeinthewall is a family run establishment it is truly a holeinthewall where service is as honey dripping sweet as their home made baklava everything is made fresh everyday portions are healthy and you feel very welcome and at home we ordered almost everything on the menu and still couldnt get enough the owner spent quite time talking with us about his family history i kept asking his ties back to ma and a very well recognized jeweler he is related to the art work and his children extremely friendly folks who put their heart and soul into their meals they serve a garlic excessive yogurt sauce that would make cardboard edible and keep dracula away for a week and man we couldnt get enough of it we dipped fries in it their lentils are fantastic as were the falafel lamb salad rice and other items on our table we literally sampled almost everything on the menu for a fraction of any of our normal meals it is a no frills cafeteriastyle place plastic utensils and paper plates people where the food is awesome flavorful inexpensive and service is warm and friendly so why is it a 5 star in my book because you cant beat the value and the soulfulness of simple food really well made exceptionally well made that has the character and the passion of the people that cook for you and take your business to heart yes even i can find 5 star dining in a hole in the wall and im glad i did this is great lebanese food served and prepared by some really down to earth people	1

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event. The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent. As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent. We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares. Please let me know you preference.	0

As I indicated to Jeff Golden yesterday, the problem with siting a project in  APS is that it typically doesn't have any long term transmission because, in  June through October, it is using the transmission to serve its native load,  even to the point of selling Palo Verde and buying Four Corners  uneconomically. Accordingly, our short term traders perceive that APS sells  transmission aggressively while our mid-marketers think that APS is the  hardest utility to buy transmission from in the Southwest. If you could  figure out some way to sell to the market during the winter and sell to APS  in the Summer it seems like that would be a good bet. However, I would wait  to talk to APS' merchant function before you submit any transmission requests  to APS' transmission function given that the traders question whether APS  may try to discriminate in favor of its merchant function. Depending on what  APS' tariff says, you may have to request interconnection on-line and you  have to request transmission on-line. I will help you do this when you're  ready.  I have tried to check APS' OASIS for two days in a row to find out if they  have transmission for the project, but the cite was down. I'll check again  today.

Here is my idea for challenging the new ISO Board. According to the trade press, one of the ISO Board's first actions will be to file with FERC to request more time to act on the FERC's requirement to file a market redesign. We (or WPTF) would file a protest asking the FERC to reject the filing because the ISO does not have the authority to act.	0

I received my Kindle as a gift and appreciate the thought. I have a large collection of books in my home, have always been an avid reader, and enjoy sharing and trading them. Its less expensive. The Kindle is good for travel or other situations where it may be easier than carrying a book. Im glad to see people actually discussing and  sharing their ideas. Yes its the kindle site but Im not an amazon rep restricted to advertising the product and avoiding discussion of its pros and cons.  It has many good points but theres room for improvement. This is a good place to voice concerns and suggestions from which other readers may benefit.  For me, reading for too long off the kindle gives me a headache and  the $12 clip on light mentioned by somebody causes glare on my screen and eyestrain  despite angle adjustments. The effects are similar to  staring at a computer screen at length. If anyone has suggestions on how to correct this, this forum is the place to do it.  My eye doctor told me to limit or quit using the kindle and she said she hears the same complaint from patients often. Perhaps there is another alternative.	1

Summary: The ISO announced today that it plans to submit a proposal to FERC  under which it will curtail firm exports (not let suppliers send electricity  out of California) during system shortages. If approved, this proposal could  have catastrophic effects on surrounding control areas because it would  transfer California's supply problems elsewhere, primarily to the Pacific  Northwest. The ISO's plan to hoard electricity violates the open access  principles of Order 888 and could possibly cause a cascade of contract  defaults if buyers in the Pacific Northwest do not receive power and are  forced to cover in this volatile market.   We can wait until the ISO files this plan with FERC at the end of the month,  or we can get ahead of this important issue and ask FERC to rule on this  before the ISO submits its report. A preemptive strike presumes that we can  overcome any procedural hurdles inherent in challenging an unfiled proposal.  The ISO has cut some EPMI's real-time schedules over the past month or two,  so perhaps we could get FERC to look at the curtailment issue in that context.  Tim has asked that the legal/regulatory team make this a top priority.  Because of its importance he also wants to make sure that he and other  traders are actively involved in preparing the FERC complaint.  Background: Today the ISO announced the details of its Market Stabilization  Plan. Although the plan may be DOA at FERC for several reasons, the ISO  declared that under this plan it intends to require in-state generators to  bid their full capacity into the proposed day-ahead market. When questioned  on the details of this, the ISO stated that, yes, it planned to curtail firm  exports of energy from California during system shortages. In other words,  during shortages the ISO would cut the transmission schedules of in-state  generators sending electricity out of California---even if those sales were  firm, and even if those sales were under existing long-term contracts.  The ISO argued that under its tariff it has the authority to cut schedules in  emergency situations. True. But the reality is that the emergency is  self-inflicted; by imposing price caps (another part of this Market  Stabilization plan), the ISO is driving supply out of California. As others  have argued, the only emergency is price: California has made a decision  to keep consumer rates artificially low, and its use of price-controls has  reduced the supply---causing a supply emergency---, and the ISO now seeks  to increase its supply by building a one-way wall around the state of  California. Like the roach motel, megawatts check into California, but they  don't check out.	0

ISO Market Participants: The ISO has posted on its web site a white paper and draft Tariff language regarding its proposed New Facility Interconnection Policy (NFIP). You can find these documents at http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/05/200103051825008351.html <http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/05/200103051825008351.html> . These documents will be the basis of the stakeholder meeting scheduled for Monday, March 19. If, as you review these documents, you have questions or comments that you would like to have addressed on March 19th, please send them to me and to Steve Greenleaf (sgreenleaf@caiso.com <mailto:sgreenleaf@caiso.com> ) by close of business on Wednesday, March 14. (In your e-mail, use NFIP Comments in the subject line.) We will do our best to address whatever issues we receive by then. The ISO will present an informational briefing on the NFIP proposal to the Governing Board on March 15. We will then bring the issue to them for a decision at their March 30 meeting. Finally, FERC has directed the ISO to submit a compliance filing with its NFIP proposal by April 2.	0

Because Avista is on Pacific Standard Time, it can't consider and respond to  your invitation for comments by noon EST. We will get back to you as soon as  we can. Our question is whether the proposed notice of bankruptcy should  categorically concede that FERC's charge back proceeding and all other  pending FERC proceedings against the CalPX are automatically stayed? Or  should we leave room for the PX and the charge back complainants to work out  an agreement that the charge back case does not involve the PX's assets, and  thus is not subject to the stay? We are seeking input from Avista's  bankruptcy counsel.	0

This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.	1

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and  EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer  filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power  into the grid to us. The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for  these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  We expect to receive authorization within 60 days. Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC  power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar  to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements. EPMI and EES will be able to file  specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the  industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.  Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may  be required in order for us to track these purchases. Thanks. Christi  37007.	0

Attached is a preliminary first draft of the WPTF comments to be filed on  Thursday with regard to the FERC Staff's market monitoring proposal.? It is  essentially based on Ben Zycher's draft paper concerning this issue.? Ben  has made a number of astute economic arguments in response to their  proposal.? In several areas, questions?are indicated, or a suggestion that  there is a need for additional material to support the statements made.?  It would be helpful to see the drafts in progress by other WPTF members.? By  reviewing them we can make sure that inconsistent observations are not made  and WPTF's own filing can be enriched by additional policy arguments  concerning the staff proposal.	0
Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power  purchases and chastised Gov. Gray Davis (news - web sites), the Legislature  and state regulators for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the  utilities can pay their bills. Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring  wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from  recovering the costs from customers. Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is  withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund''  she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10  billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys. Transferring the money  would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in debt, Connell said. She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it  amounted to a ``shell game'' that disguises the power purchases' effect on  the state budget. Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely  Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine  and required by law. They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. ``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to  demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said. Harrison said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid  with the revenue bonds. Connell's criticism of Davis, a fellow Democrat, won support from Assembly  Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who may challenge  Davis next year. Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy  woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. ``Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for  California in this time of emergency,'' he said. Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it  can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with  wholesalers.	0

I noticed Hoecker's statement too. I do not, however, believe that he is breaking new legal ground here, although the reference to Section 309 is (I believe) the first time in these cases that FERC or any of the individual Commissioners cited specifically to this section of the FPA as possible authority for ordering retroactive refunds prior to the 10/2/00 refund effective date. (I have attached Hoecker's opinion; the reference to Section 309 is on page 11.)	0

Comments Due By Wednesday, April 4th, Close of Business Most of the 19 states subject to the NOx-SIP Call rule have submitted draft  or final plans to revise their state implementation plans (SIPs) to meet the  rule's emission-reduction requirements. U.S. EPA is in various stages of  reviewing and taking action on the plans. It is expected that Northeastern  states' plans will generally be acted upon first since they were among the  first to be submitted. North Carolina and Michigan are both in the process of finalizing their plans  for implementing the NOx SIP-Call rule. Both of their rules, as currently  drafted, contain approaches of particular concern to merchant suppliers.  Specifically, both feature provisions that could limit significantly the  number of allowances available to new generating facilities.  EPSA has drafted comments to these states advocating more reasonable  approaches, which will be more likely to ensure sufficient allowances to  support capacity additions. A copy of the drafts is attached for review.  Please provide any comments on the letter to Samantha Slater at (202)  628-8200 or sslater@epsa.org no later than the close of business on  Wednesday, April 4th. Please contact Samantha Slater at EPSA for further  information.	0
A helpful FERC order as we work on asset management deals: New Horizon Electric Cooperative Inc. v. Duke Power Company, EL00201-001.  Order on Rehearing. Order issued October 11, 2000 addressing a complaint by  New Horizon Electric Cooperative, Inc (New Horizon) against Duke Power Co.  (Duke) seeking FERC resolution of four disputed issues, including treatment  of energy imbalances not prevented by dynamic scheduling. New Horizon's  complaint claimed that energy imbalance service does not apply to it, since  it will employ dynamic scheduling to effectively remove its load from Duke's  control area. Further, New Horizon maintained that any deviation between the  dynamic schedule and the actual metered delivery of energy constituted  inadvertent interchange energy (which is the net difference between actual  and scheduled interchange energy between two control areas) and proposed that  any differences would be returned in-kind within two hours. On November 9,  New Horizon filed a request for rehearing or clarification of the October 11  Order. Order issued February 26 granting New Horizon's request for rehearing  or clarification of the October 11 Order. Order clarifies that, to the extent  dynamic scheduling by New Horizon operates successfully; New Horizon should  not be subject to charges under Duke's Schedule 4 Energy Imbalance Service.  In such circumstances, any imbalances between energy deliveries on behalf of  New Horizon and New Horizon's load should be accounted for by Duke as  inadvertent interchanges only. In addition, Order directed parties to  negotiate in good faith to establish a standard for the successful operation  of dynamic scheduling.	0

The available transmision capacity (ATC) derate did occur and has occured everydaysince about the 24th. This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday. Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this information is verifiable with the ISO. Our customer contact didn't know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged. The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency. The line was again rated at zero today. I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved. I've talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston. Eric believes he can get the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade press. So check the trade press tomorrow.	0

I thought you might want to be the Tariff Integration group's liason to the Provisions/Requirements Content Group since that group is dealing with interconnection issues. You weren't at the meeting when the assignment came up so I said you might be interested in the assignment and that I would take responsibility for asking you if you wanted the job. Are you interested? I don't have your phone number. I'm at 503-464-8862.	0

i come here mainly for the veggie delight and whenever i feel guilty from eating too much junk food over the days the food here is extremely healthy trust me i know since i was briefly obsessed with nutritionfitness for a period of my life the amount of salad you get is obscenely large a good deal for the price and i swear to god that i just feel better after eating their food you almost always have portions left over so you can eat it for lunch the day after which is awesome because it means you dont have to cook very important for a college student	1
Gary Porter of Sierra called. He was very apologetic about not sending us an  interconnection agreement sooner. Attached is a draft that has not been  reviewed by Sierra's executives yet, but I talked Gary into giving it to us  anyway.  Concerning our transmission request, Gary indicated that Sierra will have to  perform a study because some other parties are supposedly ahead of us in the  queue that would affect the available transmission capacity. He referred me  to a table on the following OASIS cite showing the competing transmission  requests. Stan or Don - please look at this table to see if you think  Sierra's position has any merits. I'll give you more details in person.  Some tariff interpretation issues may also be involved depending upon whether  other parties are actually ahead of us in the queue.	0

I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	2
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).	1
It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.	2
Definitely worth checking out.	1

i came here during the fourth of july weekend in 2009 i walked in friday night with my brother about 1030pm and ended up leaving probably about 430am because we were talking to the bartender learning the history of the chili parlor and austin this was easily the best time ive ever had at a bar as a tourist and have never felt more welcome we ended up back here everyday of our stay 4 days and received the same great service and welcome feeling from the entire staff the manager even gave us suggestions for live music suiting our tastes good venues directions and other bartenders to talk to another thing that brings lots of character and conversation to this place is the fact it was used in a movie and the events that led up to and included the filming of the tarantino movie death proof they even sport the green booze from the movie in addition to the awesome history and staff the food is amazing i think i tried just about everything on the menu over those 4 days and loved everything i was served the white chili stands out most in my mind as well as the enchiladas i highly suggest checking out this little hole in the wall you wont regret it	1

eatin at hungry mother in cambridge was such a singular culinary experience for me its like nothing ive ever tasted and damn expensive too but delicious and i thoroughly enjoyed the deviled eggs the one scallop that they give you shouldnt be plural on the menu the pot of caramel the pork shoulder the pulled pork sandwich with fried onions the nacho cheese tasting pimento cheese sandwich the buttery collared greens gnocchi and all the drinks especially the nonalcoholic ones dad if youre reading this catfish is ok here the orange thousand islandy sauce is tasty but im not sure if id order it again i wasnt that into the hash and the pickled cauliflower was a bit wack maybe i just wasnt expecting that particular combination of flavors its probably an acquired taste great date place too nothing like dim lighting and a picture of thomas jefferson to get you in the mood i went here on halloween and the host was workin a little rascals alfalfa costume wicked the pear ice cake is really good but its just a block of ice cream with pear in it covered with chocolate and lacks the delicacy of the other desserts hey if youre into that go for it overall i was going to write off my kendall square food expedition as a bust until i dined here thanks mama	1

I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.	1

ISO Market Participants: Governor Gray Davis has identified a goal of bringing an additional 1,000 megawatts of new peaking resources on line to meet summer 2001 demand across the state of California. The California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) intends to purchase a significant amount of capacity and associated energy from these new resources. In order to help identify potential new resources and describe the means available to accelerate the schedule for development of these resources, CDWR in cooperation with the Governor's office, has scheduled a workshop with key representatives of state agencies and the investor owned utilities. The workshop will be on March 15, 2001 from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. at the Doubletree Hotel in Sacramento and will be followed by a reception/networking session. Attached is the agenda for this meeting along with sources of additional information.	0

Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.	0

the nice bartender told me that the reubens here are excellent and he highly recommended it i was hesitant because i never had strong feelings about reuben sandwiches one way or another i looked over at the woman sitting near me eating her reuben the appetizer portion and it looked huge she said it was the best reuben ever it peaked my curiosity so i was torn between getting an asian wrap and a regular size reuben with coleslaw eventually i committed to the reuben but with a bistro side salad instead of coleslaw as soon as i took a bite of the sandwich i knew i had made the right choice the bread was crispy the pastrami was perfectly seasoned and tender the cheese and thousand island were just the right amount it was so darn delicious i didnt want to stop eating my bistro side salad was very good toofresh greens with glazed walnuts and tomatoes and a light vinaigrette i managed to control myself and ate only half of the sandwich and took the other half home i pan grilled the other half the next day and it was still very delicious i also tasted my friends french onion soup and that was really good too there were big pieces of onions lots of cheese and a rich broth the service was about a 20 minute wait our waiter was friendly overall a very nice lunch experience	1

I believe there is a potential anti-trust issue brewing at BPA. I know BPA  is subject to different rules than most other entities, however, I have  sought to understand how they are acquiring power from customers, or allowing  some customers to install small scale generation and BPA buys that power,  without it hitting the federal transmission system.  It may not be an issue in as much as Enron, or other marketing entities, may  not want to compete with BPA to purchase power from these small generation  units.  However, if we were interested in buying this energy that's too bad because  we can't get access to it. BPA's Power Business Line (PBL) is making arrangements with local utilities  and with those utilities industrial customers through which the customer  installs small generation units and the PBL is purchasing the output. In this  instance the customers load is not reduced. BPA is concerned that if the  customer reduces load they (BPA) will lose revenue, as will the host utility  (distribution costs). So the concept is that the generator simply continue to  buy priority firm energy through the host utility and they sell the output  of the small generator to BPA. But, because it takes so long to get through  BPA's Transmission Business Line's (TBL's) interconnection and system study  process, the PBL is simply going around that process. This treats the output  as though it is going to BPA's grid without reducing the host utilities load.  However, the PBL is not seeking to interconnect these loads with the  federal grid because it takes too long to do that.  If Enron wants to buy power from a small generator, either Enron or the host  utility or the industrial customer will have to go through BPA's extensive  analysis process. In one instance I am aware of, the industrial customer  would like to get a market price for the output of their generator but BPA is  telling them they will only pay a price much lower than market ($90210 MWhr)  for the next year. The generator feels they are held hostage to BPA's offer  because they are not able to get onto the federal transmission network. Seems like anti-trust to me. Or, at a minimum, self-dealing which I believe  FERC has sought to avoid.	0

ISO Market Participants: As you may know, the ISO Governing Board, at their March 15, 2001 meeting, approved in concept the Market Stabilization Plan (MSP) proposed by the ISO. Although there was no formal motion, they directed Management to proceed with the plan and prepare a filing to be submitted to FERC this week. The proposed MSP and Lorenzo Kristov's presentation are posted on the ISO's web site at http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/09/2001030913380120705.html. When we discussed this proposal at the conference call on March 9, participants identified some implementation issues that would need to be addressed in order to implement the MSP. In addition, many of you have certainly identified other implementation issues since March 9. On Tuesday, March 27, the ISO will host a conference call from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PST to discuss MSP implementation issues.	0

Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and  EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer  filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power  into the grid to us. The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for  these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.  Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC  power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar  to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements. EPMI and EES will be able to file  specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the  industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.   Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may  be required in order for us to track these purchases. Thanks. Christi  37007.	0

AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.	2
As you may know, SB 1x (Soto/Scott) passed the Senate Appropriations  Committee by an initial vote of 7-3 (the bare minimum). Senator Soto said that the Legislature must make a bold proposition with  this bill. She said that this experience is like no consumer has been  gouged before. The Legislature must cap rates. This bill guarantees a  generous profit to generators. Senator Scott said that these generator profits have been gained off of  consumers. According to FERC, over $500 million in excess profits have been  reaped. Californians have been royally mistreated by generators. This  money has left the state (to Texas and other places). This bill is the  only solution. The PUC can change the $80 rate. Based upon the January  Field Poll, Californians support this concept. We have to stand up to the  generators and say no more. Supporters were: TURN and CTRA (Lenny Goldberg). Lenny said that the FERC  will not give any relief to CA ratepayers, so the Legislature has to. This  bill needs to be combined with the power authority by Senator Burton to hold  prices down. Other supporters of the bill included: Congress of CA Seniors; CalPIRG; CA  Consumer Federation; CA Labor Federation; SEIU; Public Power Now. SEIU  (public employee union) said that this bill is the only way to put caps on  rates. Opponents were CMTA (this is the wrong medicine for solving the problem);  WSPA (does nothing to resolve the shortage of energy; we should be doing  bills to stimulate greater investment in supply); Intergen said that they are  looking at California market, but will not build with this bill out there.  CA Wind Energy Assn (QFs oppose this bill because the rate is too low); and  IEP (most productive answer to our problem is the build power plants). Senator Battin said that the price cap is lower than some of the Governor's  long-term contracts at $86 per hour. Senator Scott said that the munis are,  indeed, covered by the bill. He also said that the PUC can change the rates  contained in this bill. Scott also said that the PUC can exempt renewables  under the bill. Senator Bowen stated that the $80 figure should be removed from the bill  (this price may be inappropriate). She suggested using the FERC proxy  price. She suggested that they look at an exemption for contracts with the  state. She saw no reason to exempt the renewables because they would make a  bundle with an $80 cap. Senator Poochigian said he was concerned about the majority vote issue  (because this bill is allegedly revenue neutral). Scott said all of the  money raised by the bill will go to ratepayers. He said that Legislative  Counsel gave him an opinion (I don't know if it is written or verbal) that  this scheme was permitted. Poochigian said it was ironic that the PUC was  being given the authority to set rates under this bill. Senator Scott stated that they would take as an author's amendment to exclude  all long-term contracts from the provisions of this bill. Next stop for the bill is the Senate Floor.	0

At some point in the incremental meltdown of the PX process, perhaps when we default on payment of the large chargeback bill we will receive today or tomorrow and the PX takes our remaining collateral, the question will suddenly be: how does one make sure one is not the last man standing? It would seem that if it is possible to ever become a former participant in the PX and not a current one, (current being the word used in the tariff to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and CTS markets. Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a possible extradited extraction from the PX. Thanks. -	0

How does the kindle having an OPTION to download and play games on it ruin the experience of your Kindle? Complaining about it doesnt make any sense.	2
Why give things away? Why not offer it to them at a price they can afford? Giving low income families kindles may sound nice, but how about offering a work for a kindle program where low income teens and adults alike could do things like work in a soup kitchen, help clean up parks, and clean graffiti from public areas for x amount of hours in exchange for a kindle?That way they would have pride in knowing they earned it, and it would prevent most of them from selling it for cash	1

I talked to a couple of folks at Southern in the last couple of days to find  out how they are reacting to the FERC Order. Bill Newman ( Sr. VP  Transmission ; leads the RTO work on market structure and transmission  planning) said they were disappointed that FERC did not respond to their  filing as a declaratory filing, but appeared to be trying to force a filing  for approval of a proposed RTO. He said, at this point, they were planning  to restart discussions with all the parties around Southern to explore  whether they could get agreement on a larger RTO, but they had not decided  that combining was necessary. He also said that it might be easier to  combine with GridSouth than Entergy, Florida, etc., but it might not work out  that way. We discussed the response from FERC concerning the treatment of  bundled retail. He was puzzled by the difference in treatment from  GridSouth, since both appear to have the same practical outcome.	0

i had a great experience at golden harbor i would recommend going with a group of people because the entrees are rather large we ordered 6 entrees for 8 people but i think we could have finished a 7th entree if we had it my favorite things that we ordered were the fried basil chicken the crispy tofu and the pork buns the basil chicken was nicely spicy and the texture of the breaded meat was wonderful the crispy tofu was in a sweet sort of sauce that i really enjoyed we assembled the pork buns ourselves because they were served as a plate of meat a container of buns and a plate of garnishes crushed peanuts some sort of veggies and cilantro the menu is very extensive so be prepared to spend some time looking through it though you really cant go wrong with the basil chicken or crispy tofu when you arrive at the restaurant you take a table number menu and ordering slip to a table of your choice then after you decide what you want you bring your order slip up to the counter and pay it works best for a group if everyone brings cash to split the cost because im not sure that they allow separate checks from one table then someone will bring your food to your table tea is free and you can simply serve yourself at the end of your meal you clear your own dishes or else pay a few dollars to have them bus your table for you	1

my parents were visiting over the holidays and we decided to give this place a try after hearing good things about it from some chinese friends the decor is okay not too shabby or overly ornate but the bathrooms were very clean we ordered from the chinese menu and tried crab and fish maw soup twice cooked pork and squirrel fish along with hot green tea and rice the soup was the least impressive of the three it was rather bland had only a tiny bit of crab meat and consisted mostly of egg white drops and this styrofoam textured thing that had no taste fish maw but it was nice and warm which hit the spot after a chilly long walk from the unc campus next the twice cooked pork came out and it was every bit as authentic as it should be it was spicy enough to make you want to gulp down rice but not so spicy that it would turn your appetite off i usually dont like spicy foods but i enjoyed this dish very much the squirrel fish came out last and it was a large fried tilapia with the bones removed but the head and tail intact it was served on a bed of shredded carrots glazed with a sweet and sour sauce and garnished with pine nuts peas and carrots i liked it because im a sucker for anything fried and covered in sweet and sour but my parents said it was a bit overcooked but we still enjoyed it nevertheless the bill came out to about 40 for the three dishes the fish being the most expensive at 18 overall i liked this place and the offerings are quite authentic as far as chinese food goes	1

i love retro old hollywood glamour small plates and theme parties so this year i decided to have a roaring 20s themed birthday dinner at cuchi cuchi we may have dressed the part a little and some boas might have shown up but we fit right in we were transported back in time as soon as we walked in super cute decor with dim lighting and fabulous music they didnt take reservations at the time we wanted to go so a group of eight of us planned to meet at the bar for some drinks even though the place was packed the bartender was attentive and helped select our cocktails they have so many options with cute names and fresh muddled ingredients it was hard to pick just one of course i settled on the alicat after some indecision since thats one of my nicknames we also tried the blackberry cosmo and a few others i cant remember the names of i was starving so we also ordered a few small plates the fried artichoke hearts and prosciutto wrapped melon they were delish the wait was about an hour since we had a larger group and it was a saturday night but we had fun chatting at the bar and the time flew by once we were seated i tried the somelikeithot for my next cocktail a spicy martini with olives that was awesome my friend ordered some of her fave small plates to get us started garlic shrimp and brie en croute and then we continued to sample as much as we could including the deep fried tomato seafood stuffed avocado cuban cigar short ribs wrapped in dough grilled skirt steak potato gratin marinated mushrooms deep fried zucchini lamb puff pastry bites salad and probably something i am forgetting my faves were definitely the artichokes brie the cuban cigar and the skirt steak our waitress was so sweet and handled our crazy loud table effortlessly plus she recommended the skirt steak which makes her even more fab and the waitresses get to dress in 20s attire which is so fun it made me want to work there lucky for you though since i might not be the best waitress i will stick to just stepping back in time for an evening of cocktails or dinner which ill be doing again real soon	1

FYI  DJ Calif Utils,State Not Close To Pwr Lines Sales Deal -Exec Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California doesn't appear to be close to reaching a  deal to buy the power lines owned by the state's three investor-owned  utilities and restore the companies to financial stability, a utility  executive told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday.  Gov. Gray Davis said this week that progress was being made and a final  agreement between the state and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric,  Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy  (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric could be reached in either days or  weeks.  But the tone in Davis's office when asked about the negotiations has  changed.  The governor realizes it's in everyone's interest to resolve this as  quickly as possible, but only if we get a good deal for California  ratepayers, not at the expense of California ratepayers, said Steve  Maviglio, the governor's press secretary.	0

We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to  sell power onto the grid to EPMI. Below is a brief outline of the FERC  licenses required. Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF  industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC. In  most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their  primary business is as a utility, like Enron).  In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform  certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site  generation customers. We expect the authorization within a month. I'll let  you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.	0

having worked in harvard square for several years grendels has always been one of my favorite spots for lunch or for drinks after work while it can get a bit crowded during the frugal period known as happy hour ive found it a relatively quiet place to lunch especially if you dont go out until 130 or 200 people have mentioned that the fondues not spectacular well in the grand scheme of fondue its not the best out there but it is still tasty cheese with bread but during happy hour its 10 between 2 maybe more people and i cant think of many places you can a vat of molten cheesy goodness for anything approaching that price ive always liked the grendel roast beef sandwich and the chicken breast sandwich with honey mustard as well as the shrimp caesar salad all of which find their way onto the lunch menu one further note it seems you can now drink alcohol outside there though sadly no happy hour on the coveted patio chairs which is something i think everyone who frequents the place has been waiting for	1

this is a love story trudys and i met when i was a freshman at ut i had a good first impression of this place it was an late lunch date on a nice thursday afternoon the fish taco touched something at the bottom of my heart but i did not realize it back then i never really got a chance to know trudys better because as a resident on ut campus i had hundreds of dining dollars i had to spend at school cafeterias later i fell in love with trudys because of the stuffed avocado with suiza sauce i was infatuated i could not get it out of my mind it was so good that i started taking all my outoftown friendsfamily members here at least once during their stays in austin then trudys transformed our relationship to the next level in january of 2006 i remembered that day so well because i turned 21 and i had the first encounter with mexican martini and cuban martini i can only say those are the most pleasurable drinks any restaurants can ever make for me every time i visit i discover more things to love about it during my lowcarb period i learned that their steak fajita salad was of great portion and with juicy beef strips and crisp vegetable during topshelf tuesdays trudys encourages me to try out luxuries i normally would not dare to try with the upcoming summer the additional outdoor seating help reduce the painful longing the socalled dreadful wait time now trudys and i have a steady relationship i graduated from college got a job and practically moved in with the north star location on burnet and 183 it takes me 1 minute to get there we are really really happy	1

Because it can sometimes be difficult to retrieve documents from the FERC  Website, we have posted the FERC order (and related press release) on the  RTO West Website, both on the RTO West proposal filing page and on the  TransConnect proposal filing page.?	0

LOVE  LOVE LOVE my Kindle and the free books are great. Have never enjoyed reading so much.	1
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.	1

What's the latest on this filing? I'd like to move forward early next week.	0
Section 309 is the provision of the FPA that grants FERC authority to take action necessary and proper to carry out the other substantive provisions of the Act, such as ensuring just and reasonable rates under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act; however, the courts have interpreted Sec. 309 as not expanding FERC's substantive authority otherwise granted under other provisions of the Act; it only provides FERC with authority as necessary for it to fill in the missing blanks in the substantive provisions of the Act, such as Sec. 206.)	0

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday rejected a bid  to force California utility companies to repay power generators for  electricity they bought under a federal government sales order, even if  utilities go bankrupt.  In a motion on the Senate floor, lawmakers killed an amendment to a broader  bankruptcy reform bill that opponents said was a dangerous proposal that  would have opened the door to involuntary bankruptcy filings by troubled  California utilities. The utilities in question are PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG -  news) Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news)  Southern California Edison.  The amendment was sponsored by Oregon Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden, Montana  Democrat Sen. Max Baucus and Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith.  Proponents said the measure would have protected the customers of the  federally-owned Bonneville Power Administration and other Northwest utilities  from unfair rate increases due to the California energy crisis.	0

Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!	2
The available transmision capacity (ATC) derate did occur and has occured everydaysince about the 24th. This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday. Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this information is verifiable with the ISO. Our customer contact didn't know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged. The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency. The line was again rated at zero today. I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved. I've talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston. Eric believes he can get the press to investigate and divulge this information for us in the trade press. So check the trade press tomorrow.	0
the deadline for entries is Friday, May 11	0

its pretty difficult to convince meateating people to check out a vegetarian or mostly vegan actually place but the ucsd hare krishna setup is one of the best places ive ever eaten at so i always invite everyone i believe ive convinced a lot of those type of people to continue eating at the hare krishna food even a year out of graduation feel like i finally accomplished something at ucsd luckily i work near ucsd now and still return on occasion anyway there are also lots of people using tupperwares or even bringing a normal ceramic plate which is great to avoid using their disposableware only complaint is that the lines can stretch extraordinarily long	1

@Maria:  Do you mean the Nook?  Be careful, books you buy for the Kindle are for that piece of electronics, and vice versa.  I love my Kindle, there are people that swear by the Nook.  They like the color screen.Me?  I want an ereader that is a reader-- so I dont need color.  The kindle battery lasts longer, and the unit isnt as heavy, which can make a difference after reading for a few hours. :)	1

This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	2

This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site. Again, the PX failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there. Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of it's availability. If Market Participants don't know about this invoice being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments. (That may be what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.	0

We have put together the following list of issues for the request for rehearing of the FERC's November 15 order. We would appreciate your input about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who will write up the various issues (Alan, Bracewell, WPTF, or EPSA). Requests for rehearing are due on January 14, 2001. We oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit $150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?) Benchmarks for forward contracts - The FERC should clarify that it will not be applying this to anything other than Cal IOU contracts. The FERC should clarify its statement that to the extent the IOUs' resources exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale, pursuant to their Commission-filed rates schedules. A literal interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and prohibit the IOUs from taking advantage of spreads between where their generation and load is located. We don't care about the IOUs trading options but we are concerned about less liquidity. Commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and PUC's request for protective order) - This issue is a placeholder pending input from Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbs. We oppose the 27-month refund period We oppose allowing the state a role in governance (WPTF) The FERC should not have rejected Dynegy & Reliant complaint concerning being paid the cost of cover for exports	0

The individual RTOs have the upper hand as far as dictating what the  scheduling practices will be. This is driven by the fact that the RTO  efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders. The  problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to  define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have  taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices. In  the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3  RTOs (there are some in theEast as well).   FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams  issues. At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function  8 is lowest on their list of priorities. Several, includig a rep from the  West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched,  will likely need FERC involvement to force a compromise or settlement.  The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams  problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves to  address the seams issues. Our argument, of course, is that these are the  entities that have the least incentive to patch the seams.  So, by August, the ESC intends to file at FERC the disposition of 26  scheduling practices - whether there is a single standard for each practice,  or exactly which ones cannot be agreed upon to be standard (e.g. - losses,  ramp rates). My supsicion is that there will be very little commonality (  for example - I am leading a group defining Congestion Management practices  that will likely find very little common practice due to the diversity of  congestion management approaches in the East) and that the filing will merely  point out that several scheduling practices need to remain inconsistent at  the borders -for reliability reasons internal to each RTO. The threat to us  is that in order to schedule between RTOs, it may require some lowest common  denominator approach that burdens one market with the ineffeciencies of  another.  If there are any pressing scheduling inconsistencies you see coming that will  impede markets in the West due to the formation of RTOs, please express those  to me as I am a bit removed from the activities of the West. Enron is party  to a petition for FERC to hold a technical conference on seams issues to  highlight the importance to the marketplace to patch the seams. I do intend  to continue representing Enron at the ESC and hopefully with some additional  FERC initiatives, put in place as many common scheduling practices as  possible.	0

As I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should  be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection (e.g., the  dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to  Transmission Service not interconnection service) Although I haven't done  a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6,  7.3, and 11.

Summer peak use may be just as difficult to meet in the US as winter  peaks have been. As new merchant plants come online on a regional basis  differentials will change a lot. But most pressure on prices medium term  will be downward, and the items to watch is where/when the new supplies show up  and where the new niche interconnects get built. In California the Gov. does not  want to let power prices go above current price caps and this will be  hard for him to do and still give price signals that will take off  demand at the peak of the market. Average electricity demand growth annually in  California has been about 3 percent per year since 1998 but less than 1 percent of new capacity has been  added. In concluding remarks, RDI's John Egan noted due to the expected crush of changes, market vigilence will be  critical for the successful participants in the gas and power markets  over the next few years.	0

In the Staff Recommendation on Prospective Market Monitoring and Mitigation,  March 2001, the FERC Staff stated that its proposed mitigation proposal is  designed to apply only to approximately 5% of the market that remains in  real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets. In addition, the  December 15 order only established a reporting requirement for sales into the  ISO and PX spot markets exceeding $150/MWh. Under the order, the refund  potential closes after 60 days of a utility filing its cost justification  unless the FERC issues written notification to the seller that its  transaction is still under review. Note well that this does not entirely  insulate EPMI concerning long term deals because the FERC's December 15 order  is still pending rehearing and parties can appeal that order once the  Commission rules.	0

In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory  and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as  follows: Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings,  it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance. However, provided there  are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized  drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not  involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard  Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.	0

i came in here with a friend before reviewing a show at the middle east to grab a quick drink it was really crowded in here and people were waiting for tables i was immediately drawn to the warmth and decor of the place it managed to be both welcoming and quirky without seeming like it was trying too hard to be hipster chic lisa the manager owner welcomed my friend and i in like we were out of town friends in for a visit she was so nice and friendly and went out of her way to find us a spot at the bar she did while we were waiting i asked her in my usual fashion if anything was glutenfree just for future reference she said the kebabs certainly are and that any of the dips could be served with tortilla chips instead of pita bread score whether or not the chips are fried inhouse and therefore contaminate by any glutenous foods fried in the same oil i couldnt say but i would certainly check before ordering she said other things on the menu probably were but as i wasnt planning on eating there that night it seemed obnoxious to go over each item once seated at the bar i ordered a glass of champagnehey every day in sally world is celebrationworthyand turns out they didnt have any available but the really nice and adorable in a cute little dress bartender gave me a single glass of one that they only sell by bottle wohoo thanks for breaking the rules cute bartender chick she was really nice i didnt get her name but she managed to be really friendly without disrupting the conversation between my friend and ithe sign of a really great bartender ill be back for kebabs bonus points for being connected to a venue i spend half my life inside	1

every time ive been to cova for dinner ive had something that blew my taste buds out of the water they change their menu constantly ive never had the same thing twice but ive never had anything i didnt like out of the four times that ive visited its completely evident when you have a meal here that the chef knows what hes doing as a general rule the plates are composed balanced creative and wellplated frankly i was surprised that the dishes seemed so well thought out because its really easy for a place listed as a wine bar to leave menu items as an afterthought and dont dare skip dessert in addition to your standard ice cream etc theres always one creative twist on a classic for example white chocolate cherry bread pudding ive picked the creative one every time and it was worth every last calorie my one minor criticism was the shrimp risotto the problem it was just okay and there wasnt much plating when the other dishes make you close your eyes in happiness just okay seems like a big contrast they also have very reasonably priced wine flights that change from time to time which is great if you like variety highly recommend cova for lets say a third date i also had my bridal shower in their wine room which was perfect for a small sophisticated cocktail party of around 1520 people	1

The ISO delayed this distribution to allow us to complete the complex calculations necessary to ensure that all funds are distributed equitably and in accordance with the ISO Tariff. In addition, PG&E transferred $177,000,000 ($171,116,114.43 net of GMC obligation) to the ISO on March 2, 2001. Such funds were intended by PG&E to satisfy PG&E obligations to the ISO through the California Power Exchange. The California Power Exchange is the subject of a preliminary injunction (Case No. 01-00901CM of the US District Court, Central District of California, Enron Power Marketing and Enron Corp. vs. California Power Exchange) which provides that CalPX shall not be required to make payments to creditors of CalPX resulting from its clearinghouse function. The ISO is discussing with its counsel the appropriate course of action to take in light of this injunction, and has placed such funds in a segregated interest bearing account until such a determination has been made.	0

The most important -- and most unpredictable -- piece of today's electric power market? Easy. Transmission. It's confusing, complex, and troublesome to follow. Add in the secondary markets, and things become even more complicated. But now there's TRANSMISSION WEEK -- and you can try it for 4 weeks risk FREE! TRANSMISSION WEEK is an electronic newsletter from the publishers of Megawatt Daily, Generation Week, Gas Daily, and other top energy publications. It will keep you informed on every regional transmission organization -- what's working and what's not. Get the lowdown on settlement systems, bidding rules, price caps, generation interconnections, seams issues, and other controversies. TRANSMISSION WEEK makes sense out of new and evolving markets for transmission rights and congestion contracts.	0

Currently, (for the East) Thane takes the summaries of Northeast  orders/filings and sends them to the traders/originators/reg folks, etc. I  look at the rest of the East info and send it/take it to the appropriate  trader/originator/developer/reg person (EPMI and EES). I also alert someone  in our group if I think that we need to intervene/protest/participate.   What I will start doing to make sure the loop is complete is to email the  report to Joe, Mary, Jim, Rick and Sarah with my comments on what I have done  (for example, alerted traders/developers to issues, alerted state reg. people  to retail filings, etc.) and whether I think EPMI or EES need to get involved  in any of the cases.	0
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.	2

Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.	1
As we previously reported, on March 14, 2001, FERC announced certain actions  to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in  an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas  Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further  Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption. The  following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to immediately  help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory  incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure. The  Commission also invited comments on certain proposals. This memo includes a  list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.	0

A member of our group asked me to add the following item to the agenda for  Monday's conference call: 5. Would there be any utility in invoking the ISO's arbitration procedures  (naming the ISO as a defendant and interpleading SCE and PG&E) for purposes  of obtaining a ruling that the ISO, SCE and PG&E have violated the ISO's  tariff by defaulting to market participants? Similarly, would there be any  utility in invoking the PX's arbitration procedures seeking a determination  that SCE and PG&E have violated the PX's tariff in their defaults, and  whether we are presently enjoined from pursuing this option against the PX in  light of the automatic stay? In addition to seeking repayment (which  obviously is presently problematic), the purpose we would seek a full  accounting of outstanding amounts owed by and to whom in the arbitration, and  to obtain a finding by the arbitrators that could be helpful in possible  future litigation against SCE and PG&E.	0

Mary, did you get this forwarded to Nevada/Sierra? If not, could you please  do so ASAP? We need to keep this moving with all possible speed. I could do  this for you, but you have been the principal contact on the Agreement for  continuity. Let me know if there is something I could do. Also, as we  discussed the other day, we should be trying to set up a meeting with  Nevada/Sierra as soon as practicable to work through open items. Thanks, Mary.

Attached are draft EPSA comments in response to the Commission Staff's  recommendations on market monitoring and mitigation in California. As  explained in an earlier memo, these proposals are designed to replace to $150  price break set out in the Commission's December 15th order, which is  scheduled to run only until April 30th. While supporting certain aspects of  the Staff's recommendations, including the extremely limited application and  the use of a single price auction, EPSA's comments focus on the failure of  the Commission's cost-based approach to capture the full costs of capacity,  scarcity, opportunity cost, risk and operating costs and the problem of using  a cost-based approach during periods of scarcity.	0

On March 8, we notified you that the ISO had received a direct payment of about $171 million from PG&E ($177 million less GMC obligation) with direction from PG&E that these funds were in payment for transactions on the ISO Controlled Grid in December 2000, scheduled by the California Power Exchange (PX) as PG&E's Scheduling Coordinator, and invoiced to PG&E by the PX for remittance to the ISO. We notified you further that the ISO had placed these funds into a segregated interest-bearing account pending resolution of their distribution. The PX has provided notice that it has filed suit in the Central District of California against the California ISO and moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO), requiring the ISO to transfer these funds to the CalPX. Copies of the complaint and the TRO application are attached below. As represented by the PX in its complaint and moving papers, the ISO does not intend to oppose the PX's TRO application. To the best of the ISO's knowledge, a hearing on the TRO application has not yet been set.	0

Most of the dust has settled from the flurry of RTO West filings, motions, interventions, comments, protests, and answers that have consumed all of our attention over the past few weeks. In looking through the list of filed documents on the RTO West website, one can't help but be struck by the incredible amount of hard work that has gone into the analysis and drafting of the documents submitted to FERC. We appreciate the dedication of everyone to making the RTO West proposal as strong as possible.	0

Dynegy: Enron a 'Model Competitor' It doesn't happen very often, so we're noting an apparently spontaneous  comment from Dynegy Counsel Ed Ross at a FERC Roundtable last week that one  of his chief competitors, Enron, has done an excellent job of being  competitive. He suggested others could look to Enron as a model competitor.  They've done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a  strong physical desk and we don't see any problem with it. I think they have  set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the  regulated and unregulated aspects of their business.  Ross had prefaced the remark, midway through a heated debate on affiliate  abuses, with the comment that this is not an industry-wide problem. I  believe there are good and bad players in the market today.  Earlier, Enron's Leslie Lawner had invited all of you to spend the day on  Enron's trading floor, because I assure you, you will not see a more  competitive environment anywhere. There is no way these folks, who fight like  cats and dogs among themselves, would voluntarily transfer value to the  pipeline group for the good of the bottom line. Lawner had to quickly back  off the invitation - mentioning confidentiality restrictions - when it  appeared about half the room was ready to troop over to the trading floor.	0

Can the three of you determine how best to cover this report and ensuring  that the desk has the right information ASAP? I assume that we can take away  most of the information by just reading the report.  This may prove to be nothing more than another exercise in futility by the  ISO, but we should cover this to make sure nothing negative is implemented.	0

Frankly, I am more comfortable with 90 days. Its easier to complete a  project early and send out the info prior to the due date, then to have to go  back and ask for more time.

The people on the To list have been selected to attend an Energy Math  training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the  River Room at Two World Trade Center. Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with  a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday  morning. We want to have 15 people attend this course. I realize that this  is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can  find a replacement.  I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over  the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the  needs of people who work on this floor. The goal is to provide a  comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the  foundation of analyzing energy problems. The course is loosely based on a  graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several  people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently  published.  This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being  offered. As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress. Chris  Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity  to take this course between now and the end of the year. We have selected a  cross-section of people for this first session. Some people have a lot of  experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others  are new to the business. We are hoping that the course will be helpful to  people with different backgrounds. Each participant in the class is not only  responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give  constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course  better. You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide  feedback. This feedback is part of the program. If you aren't willing or  don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us  with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for  the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list  for this session.  Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the  next course is offered in a month or so. With your help, we will be able to  improve the training for the people who come after you. Thanks in advance  for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.	0

mani is the best new restaurant in the area food is fresh and flavorful staff is kind and decor is eclectic and visually stimulating the beet appetizer was perfectly prepared and i had to hold myself back from ordering another this dish is a musthave for any beet lover pistachio pizza was a pleasant surprise and the word pizza does this gem no justice the cheese was thinly dispersed over flat crispy dough and there was more focus on toppings pistachios onions and a touch of rosemary yum dessert was vanilla gelato with espresso poured over top and it was my absolute favorite part of the meal i would highly recommend this for anyone who isnt crazy about the classic sweet treat as the gelato and espresso compliment each other perfectly and keeps the flavor of sugar down to a minimum when you decide to dine at mani be sure to call ahead and get your name on the list to avoid a long wait	1

In case you haven't heard, the Supreme Court has granted cert of our and the  state of New York's cert petitions on the extent of FERC's jurisdiction over  transmission facilities.  Date: Mon, 26 Feb 2001 11:18:06 -0600 From: Jeffrey Watkiss <dwatkiss@bracepatt.com> Subject: Fwd: Supreme Court Action in FERC Cases Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary==_570CFA0B.E081E8A6  Attached is Lou Cohen's (of Wilmer Cutler) write up of the Supreme Court's  grant of two petitions for certiorari in the appeals of FERC's Order No. 888  on transmission open access. While too much should never be read into a  grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate  Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory  in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are  asking the Court to expand the native load exception. It should also be  noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert.  petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.  Enron's brief is due in 45 days. Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next  week to get this process started. Please call me if you have any questions.	0

amazing food i like that the menu is small this means everything is fresh the cheese steak is lemme put it this way your philly friends will approve the flavor is right the bread is tender and fresh and the ribeye is so tasty 7 bucks for cheese steak or korean food is really cheap the portions are big too i love this place for lunch or dinner i usually get the bim bim bop japchae or sun dun boon try their soups i know the names might be unfamilar but on a rainy or cold day it really warms the soul it reminds me of moms home cooking im not korean but i can still see the care that went into the preparation of their meals the atmosphere is very casual which is much appreciated in an increasingly gentrified ann arbor no fancy attire needed the owner and his wife are wonderful people they were so welcoming and inviting to their guests i asked mr sim if he opened on sunday and he said no we rest and watch a korean drama show lol the owners are such humble and sweet people they dont hire any help and its literally the two of them working all day long if you want to support local businesses it doesnt get any more local than this	1

Mr. Meisch, its ok; calm down :-P. Yes, they have games but the ones that I have tried (I have about 5 on my Kindle along with 30 gazillion books) are either text based or just simple time killers. So far they are actually decent (well, what Ive tried is anyway. Ive heard of some awful ones).I have the one they are touting here and its... ok. Not my favorite (try Triple Town; its addictive) but this one is decent enough. The beginning is too easy by far, the middle is good and the end levels are killer.	1

Attached is our initial markup of the above, together with a blackline  against the new draft you provided from Nevada Power (please open the  documents as soon as you can so we can be sure they will do so as there were  some conversion issues to our system - ignore the table of contents, etc.,  for now). This is still somewhat rough and will need considerable input from  Don Hammond on the technical issues. We did not make any changes to the  schedules and attachments this turn on the assumption that these will be  addressed as we go forward (and are quite skeletal at this point in any  case). We did endeavor to capture most of Mary Hain's comments from the  prior email but as the new draft is so different from the prior one I am not  sure we succeeded in all respects. The good news, of course, is that the new  draft they sent is vastly superior to the old one for this application. We  have tried not to make many redrafting changes but let us know if there is  anything you feel we should revisit. We are continuing to review some items  for further changes. Please note that there are questions in bold in the  draft which are directed to ENA personnel and internal counsel and are not  for distribution to Nevada Power and therefore this draft needs to be revised  by us before it goes out to anyone outside of Enron. I apologize again for  the delay in getting this to you but it has been extremely busy hereabouts of  late. Please let me know when you'd like to discuss. I can be reached in  our San Francisco office after about 10:00 am SF time tomorrow (415-9512100)  but should be back in Denver on Friday.	0

Senators Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., and Jean Carnahan, D-Mo., have asked the General Accounting Office (GAO) to inquire into whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is carrying out its responsibilities to ensure that wholesale electricity sales throughout the country are reasonable and that interstate natural gas pipelines are fulfilling their obligations to customers. Under federal law, FERC has the responsibility to ensure just and reasonable prices for interstate wholesale transmission, the Senators said in a letter to GAO, but there is mounting evidence that FERC may not have fulfilled this role in the California situation.	0

FERC has stated in several orders what it considers material changes. You  may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok  with the interpretations. Those are some of the orders that I would look to  should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change. Also, per your comments on No. 16. I agree with you on commenced  construction. What I mean by commenced includes the utility purchase of  easements, etc. I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing  to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to  proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the  costs. [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC  decision.]] Thanks.	0

i started frequenting pint night tuesdays at dog and duck two years ago i live a couple of blocks away almost everything on tap is cheaper the crowds are a good cheerful size the bartenders are efficient yet helpful and theres always some fun people i have discovered most of my favorite beers at dog and duck under the tutelage of the staff i have a porch fetish i love sitting outside beer in one hand cigarette in the other always an interesting sometimepassionate conversation dog and duck dd has not one but two massive porches one in the front one in the back pint night was the entirety of my dog and duck experiences for about a year and then last summer i went to spend a week in south padre with a few friends and that changed quiet a few things the first was i tried food on the dog and duck menu as a direct result of going to south padre i will get to that story in a bit but in south padre i also got the most uptight person i know to name my nuts it was a sort of personal challenge judge me all you want but that poor soul now has an exciting story to share with all her friends for the rest of her life this one time i went parasailing and i ended up naming my friends nuts i also went parasailing by the way which was a little uncomfortable what with my fear of heights oh i also slipped through my harness and had a wedgie the entire time i was floating a few hundred feet above that island back to the dog and duck menu on the way back from padre we were driving by dog and duck it was open but not very crowded we went in walked up to the bar and i actually picked up a menu from the pile at the bar that i had always simply and regretfully ignored they had cheeseburger on the menu i love cheeseburgers so i ordered one even though the burger and drink cost about 10 but there was nothing cheaper on the menu and the massive burger came with a massive serving of fries ever since i make a biweekly foodfocused pilgrimage to dog and duck and overwhelmingly usually get a cheeseburger with jalapenos fries on the side a dr pepper if its too early or an ipa if its appropriate drinking time dog and duck has by far the best cheeseburgers ive had in austin yes better than huts yes better than p terrys yes better than sportini the menu also features other great pub food items on the menu the queso is satisfactory the jalapeno poppers rock my world the fish and chips are good as infamous british food can get i have taken a lot of friends and especially people from out of town to this almosthidden little gem austin has and theyve always come back for more my brother always makes a stop at dd everytime hes in town now great staff great selection of beer great food always interesting conversations and two orgasmically good porches dd is a great place to go for a few beers during the week or to satisfy a cheeseburger craving or to just to go for a spontaneous adventure	1

first of all you have to take it as it is cheap college food so given that if you want some foie grois this place isnt for you but if you want some food thats worth every cent this is the place like everyone else i must recommend the special carne asada or the nachos try to hit it up when its not crowded so come for an early lunch opens at 11 i think or a late dinner closes at 1 its small so take your food back to your dorm apt frat house whatever and their salsa and chips hit the spot too so yummo as a starving student your belly will be the only thing youre busting not your wallet	1

excellent food and excellent service came here for the first time with my girlfriend and ordered a variety of dishes here they are shrimp chorizo snack good but very strong flavor and spices not sure if i could eat this as an entire meal but snack is just the right size braised oxtail appetizer must order this was phenomenal the serving was almost the size of an entree make sure to try this dish cous cous crusted swordfish excellent i ordered this entree for myself and it was delicious i would definitely order it again the apples really added a nice touch woodgrilled lamb rack very good we ordered mediumrare but looked more rare than i would have liked still the dish was tasty would order medium next time but thats just me the waiter was incredibly friendly and suggested some restaurants closer to our apartment overall a wonderful experience if you are planning to watch a movie at the nearby kendall cinema the restaurant has a special theatre menu to get you your food quickly so you can watch your show on time	1
I have not gone over the filing in great detail, I have found one thing we may want to file to address. All the parties except PGE/Sierra/Nevada agreed to eliminate the export fees. PGE/Sierra/Nevada made a joint filing asking the FERC to require the RTO West to include export fees and their effect in the financial modeling of their Stage 2 filing. I think we should consider filing comments to oppose this requiest from PGE/Sierra/Nevada for the following reasons:	0

one of my favorite restaurantsdiners in ann arbor and some of the best korean ive ever eaten the dol sot bi bim bap served in a piping hot stone bowl is awesome and for downtown ann arbor is very moderately priced i also like that they have two sauces to accompany the bi bim bap a sweet and a spicy red sauce both of which are tasty i like the combo meals as well which include miso soup two differently prepared meats rice and different sides depending on the meal the teriyaki dishes are good as well the sushi is mediocre but ultimately the korean food is where this place shines i lived down the street from this place my senior year of college and used to frequent it quite often the service was great and the owner also named eric haha was very friendly and even starting occasionally offering me free menu items after regularly eating there for about a year nice people and good food what more can you ask for note teriyaki time is not a sitdown restaurant with waiter service its fastcasual like chipotle or cosi where you order pay and then pick up your food and sit down	1

I was asked to set up a conference call for Monday (3/19) at 3:00 Eastern  with regulatory and bankruptcy counsel for the nine Complainants to discuss  the interrelation between the FERC Chargeback complaint proceeding (and the  Amendment 22 matter), the District Court case before Judge Moreno, and the  Bankruptcy proceeding, and to discuss strategy. Dial-in #: 1-800-403-2008 Participants #: 143570 The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion:  1. Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay;  including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of  motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's  motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing  date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding;  2. Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of  collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay.  3. Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all  collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing  and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs.  In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds  the total of the foregoing matters?  4. Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer to  PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 22 proceeding; including the  timing of such filings with FERC.  This email does not address bankruptcy counsel for all parties. If you wish  to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of  the time and relevant information for the call. This call will likely be extremely unwieldy, so I would request the parties  to consolidate their participants where possible. Also, please do not  forward this information as it addresses confidential litigation matters.	0

I just spoke with Steve Doss and explained how to get a power marketer  certificate at FERC (and EWG filing if necessary depending on who West Linn's  partner is for plant ownership) and the 60 day (generally) time required  (Although I think that FERC would be inclined to wave the 60 days based on  the supply shortage in the West). I also explained that EPMI is making a  filing this week at FERC that would allow EPMI to provide some FERC filing  services on behalf of industrial customers in order to facilitate their sales  to the grid (when approved, hopefully in about 60 days). He said that West  Linn has not built the 2 cogens yet (43 MWs each of which West Linn would use  appr. 17 MWs/hour), but that it is interested in setting up its licenses  before the start of retail access on 10/1/01 in Oregon. (An item to think  about--I don't know anything about the Oregon retail program or current rate  structure with PGE, but generally the lack of retail open access will not  prevent an industrial on site generator from selling to the grid, unless its  host utility rate schedule precludes it from doing so).  I am sending him a FERC order issued last year dealing with industrials  selling to the grid (InPower order), plus will send him the EPMI filing when  we make it later this week.	0

The Governor held his press conference today at the co-generation plant at the University of California Medical Center in Sacramento. All local TV, print and radio news media outlets sent representatives. Although the focus of the news conference was supposed to be introduction of a legislative package promoting renewable energy, distributed generation and co-generation, it quickly turned to how the Governor will deal with the possible bankruptcy of the utilities. The Governor said that it has become increasingly obvious to him that the best solution to the utilities' financial problems is the acquisition of transmission lines. He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities most significant asset and would be something the public would be able to get value from in perpetuity. He said the arrangement will likely be a lease of the utilities' lines, with the companies continuing to maintain them, to capture [the utilities'] expertise. Details of this plan will be announced on Friday, the Governor said. The time and place for this announcement have yet to be released.	0

2.3 Delete last sentence. If Enron is already in the queue (or  considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at  FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to  remain in the queue. I don't think this is necessary and all are protected  because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue.  4.3 Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost  unfortunately). It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days. PGE is  protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a  notification.  6 ((I realize that this language was included in CP&L, but recommend these  changes for PGE.)  6.1 Add after as modified by the Commission if Customer chooses to  commence construction. 6.2 Modify last sentence -- The Agreement will provide milestones toward  placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make  reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after  notification and opportunity to remedy.)	0

In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory  and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as  follows: Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings,  it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance. However, provided there  are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized  drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not  involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard  Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.	0

Good Morning, We will be rolling out a new version of Deal Entry & Deal Blotter this  afternoon to support California scheduling & volume management. For most of  the users, there will be no impact except for a few new fields that can be  ignored in Enpower's Deal Entry. Below is a list of the changes:  Deal Entry (These fields should only be populated for California deals) 1. Added Settlement Entity - Identifies where the power is scheduled and  settled.  2. Added Sched Coordinator - Identifies the coordinator responsible for  scheduling the power.  3. Schedule Type - Defines the type of schedule used in California.  4. Market Reference - Defines the market when the power will flow.  Deal Blotter  1. Deal Blotter will be defaulting these 4 values if the deal is in  California.	0

Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI  wants to submit an offer on. PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for  50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's  system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North. Offers are due by March 28 and PGE  has until April 5, 2001 to accept .  I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the  terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff. I have also told him that EPMI  could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory  risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's  favor. I would recommend the former. Ron - would you tell me how much you  would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review, in the event PGE accepts  our offer? Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing. Is that  okay?	0

I'd like to expand on the last point. The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should report that information subject to confidentiality. Also, if contrary to our wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault.	0

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no  day ahead balanced schedule requirement). This means that the RTO should  post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at  this time is PJM's real time market). A real time energy market is  fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to  base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis. It also provides  the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission  is needed. Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability  to provide more financial tools to customers. This market can be nodal (or  zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY  City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined proxy  buses.  While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect  congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now),  the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the  establishment of the real time energy market. Regulatory people should use  their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push  option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs. Such a physical  market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.  If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to  load. Ideally, the load should have an network right from the generator to  their load (or from load to the hubs) in order to have the ability to  manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use  customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals. The nodes should be  grouped into logical zones and congestion within a zone should be uplifted.  This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes  critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.  Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium  to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced.   Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market  like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it  has contracted for enough reserves.) We have urged the FERC in Florida to  adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for  lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they  are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they  demonstrate continued compliance.  Bottom line -- Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Congestion  does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is  done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient  real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the  generation (supply) and the load (demand). This type of market will provide  greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.   Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a  real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on  non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load  exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.	0

Richard: In connection with EPMI's contention in the various California  litigations that they should be dismissed due to FERC's primary jurisdiction,  it strikes me that it may be helpful to lodge FERC's March 9, 2001 order with  the Court. While FERC, in the 12/15 order, established its investigation,  the March 9 order makes findings and imposes remedies (fortunately not  against us). This should enhance the primary jurisdiction argument. FERC's  intent to occupy the field could not be more clear.	0

I talked to Brian Whalen today. He is trying to get an interconnection  agreement finalized to send to us tomorrow. Sierra/Nevada have abandoned  their attempts to use the generation divestiture interconnection agreement  they sent us before and is falling back on their old interconnection  agreement, updated to reflect recent FERC orders. Brian was very apologetic  about taking so long.   He said Sierra/Nevada is also attempting to comply with our request that they  send us a transmission agreement by the end of the month.  He asked me if we had gotten the Avery and Fischer reports (that would become  Appendices A-C to the interconnection agreement). I said I didn't know but  that if he would E-mail them to me that I would make sure the appropriate  people got them.   Lysa- when I get these reports please forward them to Don.	0
went to catalyst this past monday night for dinner with a friend the food wasincredible i want to go back immediately ill resist for a little bit for the sake of my waistline but seriouslyyum also the space is pretty neat i dont know what the building was before maybe a lab but the high ceilings and industrial feel is pretty cool it was a little funny when we arrived and were seated we had 2 different waiters approach us to ask if we wanted a drink and tell us about the specials not sure if they were fighting over the table or something but it was quickly resolved and we only saw one after that sadly they were out of the crispy quail appetizer something i had really hoped to try as well as the candy roaster squash tortellini i guess i will have to go back for those i settled on the carmelized onion soup to start and it was delicious really great texture and flavor with the perfect amount of cheesy raclette toast in it my friend had the duck confit salad and really liked it it looked pretty delicious for my main course i had the tournedos of beef oh my god i hope they always keep that on the menu it was so good so so so good its 2 3oz filets each on a bed of garlicky buttery swiss chard and parsley sauce and topped with a taleggio ravioli there were just 2 raviolis one for each tournedo but that worked well the flavors were so incredible together i am not a fan of swiss chard in general but this was delicious and the parsley sauce or whatever it was all on top of was todiefor i really cannot wait to go back and have this again which is a problem because i also want to try their chick pea fritters and their pastas and their chicken and and and and my friend had the pork chops and really liked that as well we shared a side of the drippings potatoes not quite as exciting as wed hoped with a name like that i dont know i envisioned buttery and dripping in an oniony fatty sauce or something but they were still tasty for dessert we shared the pear almond tart it was very different than what we expected in terms of appearance but it was really really tasty and the creme fraiche ice cream was a really neat accompaniment in conclusion it was delicious and i want to go back again and again and again to try more dishes and have the ones that i already had again	1

This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event. The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent. As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent. We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares. Please let me know you preference.	0

In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory  and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as  follows: Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings,  it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance. However, provided there  are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized  drafts in advance of filing. RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not  involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues. On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard  Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.	0
FOLSOM, Calif. (CBS.MW) -- California's electricity grid operator said  rolling blackouts could continue Tuesday as idled generating plants and the  lack of payments to small suppliers prompted a drop in operating reserves to  critically low levels.  We are projecting the possibility of outages sometime between 10 o'clock  (Pacific time) this morning and 8 o'clock this evening, Jim Detmers, vice  president of operations at the California Independent System Operator, said  at a Tuesday morning conference call.  Detmers said that two large generation units that had been expected to be  back online by Tuesday morning, failed to be repaired on time.  The Cal ISO now expects one unit to return by noon Tuesday, with the other  coming back online at midnight.  Additionally, power imports are down by 800 megawatts compared to Monday,  Detmers said, citing exhausted water resources.  The tight power condition will exist today and may even exist into tomorrow  as well, he said. A lot depends on what all of California does to conserve  energy.  As of Tuesday morning, the state had more than 12,000 megawatts of planned  and forced generation unit outages.  Power levels from small generators remain extremely low with only about  3,000 megawatts of the total 5,000 to 6,000 megawatts of electricity in  operation.  The Cal ISO has said that the small generators are suffering from financial  concerns and an inability to purchase fuel to run the plants.  California suffered 32-straight days at its highest power alert earlier this  year in part due to the inability of the state's utilities' to purchase  enough power for their customers.  Southern California Edison (EIX: news, msgs, alerts) and another of  California's big utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG: news, msgs, alerts)  , have combined debts of more than $13 billion from buying wholesale power on  the open market that they must supply to customers at rates capped by state  regulators. See related story.  Blackouts hit electric customers around the state on Monday, from San  Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf to Beverly Hills. Bay Area media reported Cisco  Systems was forced to stop work at one of its Silicon Valley plants.  The blackouts began at noon Monday and continued until about 8 or 9 p.m.  Power for most customers was interrupted for only about 60 to 90 minutes.  The Cal ISO will reassess the power situation and hold a conference call at  10:30 a.m. Pacific time.  Myra P. Saefong is a reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com in San Francisco. The  Associated Press contributed to this report.	0

If I take the total volume, and multiply that by the total hours, I get a total of 318,557,665,950.40 mwh. Is this what was physically flowing? If so, then I think this number is wrong.

I was asked to set up a conference call for Monday (3/19) at 3:00 Eastern  with regulatory and bankruptcy counsel for the nine Complainants to discuss the interrelation between the FERC Chargeback complaint proceeding (and the Amendment 22 matter), the District Court case before Judge Moreno, and the  Bankruptcy proceeding, and to discuss strategy.  The following issues have been identified as issues for discussion:  1. Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay; including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of  motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's  motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding;  2. Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of  collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay.  3. Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all  collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&E, and (3) reasonable costs. In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds the total of the foregoing matters?  4. Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer to PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 22 proceeding; including the timing of such filings with FERC.  This email does not address bankruptcy counsel for all parties. If you wish to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of the time and relevant information for the call.  This call will likely be extremely unwieldy, so I would request the parties to consolidate their participants where possible. Also, please do not  forward this information as it addresses confidential litigation matters. Thanks. See you Monday. Ron	0

Im going to agree with Margaret on this one. The fact is that reading is a learned skill and there are many countries which havent yet learned it. Its just plain ignorant to think that there ARENT people who dont have this skill.

Oops. Didn't mean MWs last time. But I do think that some cutoff higher than 25 kWs is appropriate for net metering purposes.

With the continued growth of some of the more non-traditional businesses at  Enron; e.g., broadband, agricultural commodities, steel, etc..., it has  become apparent that additional support from Government Affairs, of these and  other non-traditional businesses, is necessary. To that end, I've asked  Harry Kingerski to focus his time and efforts more fully on developing his  support group's (Government Affairs Support Services) capabilities, with an  objective of broadening their support beyond EES and ENA. With the void that  Harry leaves in formally directing our group's efforts on behalf of EES, I've  asked Jim Steffes to assume a leadership role with respect to EES as well as  ENA. I've also asked Lisa Yoho to assume responsibility for Enron Industrial  Markets in addition to her responsibility for Enron Global Markets and Enron  Networks. No further organizational changes are being made at this time but,  as always, organizational flexibility in how our group responds to the needs  of the business units will be the order of the day. I am confident that all  of us will support Harry, Lisa and Jim with their additional  responsibilities. Thank you.	0

As you can see from my other email, I took a wack at supplementing the  EPSA/WPTF comments with some additional stuff on hyrdro. I will try to get Tim Belden's read on whether my insert is important or not  to include but I would appreciate your feedback too. Re: EPSA's draft: It is very good. My only comment is that, beginnign on p.  3, EPSA should more directly attack the concept of economic witholding.  There really is no such thing (or it really is not different that physical  witholding). If you raise your price above the opportunity cost in the  market, your buyer will go to that other resource and thus you won't be able  to economically withold.	0

The CA ISO has received a number of requests for historic unit specific outage information, consistent with the outage data that is posted daily on the CA ISO website. Because the CA ISO has determined that there are no legal or policy reasons to treat this information as confidential, the CA ISO will provide such data in response to the requests (and any subsequent requests). Unless there is a change to tariff section 20.3.2, the CA ISO will NOT make publicly available generator outage programs submitted to the CA ISO (i.e. information on planned prospective outages). The CA ISO notes that the historic information on generator outages that is in the CA ISO's possession is highly unreliable until beginning of 2001. While the CA ISO will provide historic outage information in its possession in response to properly submitted requests, the CA ISO does not and will not vouch for the accuracy of data for years 1998, 1999 and 2000.	0

Big Disappointment with calendar sync.	2
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Breaking away from a pack of creditors owed billions by  Southern California Edison, Caithness Energy got permission Wednesday to  secure a lien against one of the utility's plants. The judgment lets the New York-based electricity supplier to attach a partial  claim on an Edison facility in Laughlin, Nev. -- a move that could spur  bigger creditors to launch similarly aggressive approaches or even force  Edison into bankruptcy. Caithness, which has two Nevada plants owed $20 million by Edison, was  allowed to attach the lien by U.S. District Judge Lloyd George of Las Vegas. Once it becomes final in the next few days, the claim will be the first lien  successfully placed against an Edison asset since California's energy crisis  began last year. An Edison spokesman said the utility will seek a stay of the order next week. A lien allows a creditor a better chance of getting paid by laying claim to  all or a portion of any future sale of a property. The judge allowed  Caithness to file for a 56 percent interest in the plant, which employs 309  people and is valued at $530 million. The energy was used by Edison to feed California's energy grid, Caithness  attorney Philip Korologos said Thursday. Edison owes Caithness a total of $100 million, and another $20 million bill  will come due at the end of March, Korologos said. They took delivery of the power and they are supposed to pay us for the  power,'' Korologos said. But whether Caithness will go after Edison's California assets is far from  certain. Korologos said he believed that some form of additional mediation is  required for California liens that might make such an option less attractive  in the utility's home state. Edison's bigger creditors, including Reliant Energy of Houston, declined to  speculate on whether they will employ a similar tactic. But industry experts said that the Caithness move could cause other, bigger  creditors to feel pressure to act more aggressively on behalf of  shareholders. The law requires only three major creditors to band together to  force Edison into involuntary bankruptcy; the utility has said it does not  intend to file on its own. So far, most creditors have chosen to simply wait, or ``forbear,'' on the  Edison debts, having fielded repeated pleas by Edison to do so. At least four  creditors or groups of creditors have sued the utility for money owed but  have taken no further action. A New York-based creditor last month unsuccessfully tried to attach a lien to  an Edison bank account without success, an Edison spokesman said. Edison's problems began last year when, under California's 1996 deregulation  law, investor-owned utilities were forced to buy power on the soaring spot  market while limiting the rates they could charge consumers. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric say they owe creditors a  combined $14 billion.	0

Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and  therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego  has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the California  markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of  costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential  refund obligations. It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are  being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.	0

The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.	2
I bought two of them and neither will charge.	2

Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.	1
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex.	1
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.	1
pastries brownies doughnuts breads cakes cupcakes cookies danishes muffins and more reasonable prices and fresh goodies today was my first experience at prantis bf and i walked in and it was packed but the wait was not long before someone asked what we wanted my eyes darted back and forth trying to pick something that was a challenge finally after talking to the counter girl my bf and myself i decided to go with a brownie and a cookie bf picked a doughnut the bill came to under 4 bucks the chocolate chip cookie was as thick as a blondie bar but bigger in circumference the brownie was enormous and has walnuts in it the doughnut was chocolate and vanilla frosted and my man ate it up within 2 seconds flat addicting delicious baked treats the coffee cakes here with the white powdery stuff on top looked so good maybe next time	1

You'll love it!   1 This movie is BAD.   0 So bad.   0 The film is way too long.   0 This is definitely one of the bad ones.   0 The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.   1 John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.   1 His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.   1 I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.   1 I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.   0 I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.   0 It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.   0 Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.   0 Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.   1 His performance is simply genius.   1 He owns the film, just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.	1

ISO Market Participants: The ISO has developed a market stabilization plan, designed to stabilize operations and control costs in California, to be implemented in the next two months. It would remain in place for the near term (through Summer, 2001 and beyond) and includes changes to existing ISO practices as well as an expansion of the ISO's responsibilities. Because of the need to move quickly so that the plan can be implemented by this summer, we will be unable to hold a full stakeholder review process. But, we do want to discuss the plan with you so that you can understand the proposal and the reasoning behind it. The ISO will post this plan on the ISO web site at http://www.caiso.com/stakeholders/ <http://www.caiso.com/stakeholders/> , by COB tomorrow. In addition, we will host a conference call from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. PST this Friday, March 9, to discuss the plan with you and clarify any outstanding issues. We then plan to request the Board's approval for this plan on March 15th in order to be able to implement the plan by summer.	0

Do you ever get the feeling that the idea you posted into the Idea Vault  isn't looked at by anyone or going anywhere? Well, listen to this. Steve  Gullion, EES IT manager, deposited an idea about economic data derivatives.  And guess what? The Xcelerator liked the idea so much that they are now  working on a business plan.  Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage)  now and post the idea that has been brewing in your brain!  We've all heard Jeff Skilling say we need to earn our way out of the  current Enron share price slump. One way we can accomplish this is by doing  a better job of managing company expenses. Ask Kevin Hannon, CEO of Enron  Global Asset Services and Policy Committee member, all your questions about  how we can earn our way out, together. Tuesday, June 19 on eSpeak at 10 a.m.  Houston time.  Can't make the live event? No worries. Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your  question. Kevin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the  transcript later.  After Kevin's eSpeak, we'll be opening a category in eMeet  http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf called Cost Savings  Initiatives so you can continue talking amongst yourselves and helping Enron  save. (And if you've got some great cost saving ideas, don't forget you can put them into the Idea Vault in the ThinkBank!)	0

What a delightful and joyful article! I was in a very smart restaurant in Goa about 2 months ago reading my Kindle - the guy at the next table got out his iPad for nothing seemingly more than a bit of showing off. The waiters were fascinated by the Kindle and all wanted to play with it. They ignored the iPad.	1

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a single sum distribution, in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.	0

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California Republican Sen. Jim Battin on Thursday  introduced legislation that will enable the state's electric utilities and  small, independent generators to proceed with a new deal on pricing power  supplies.  The bill, if enacted, would lower the prices paid to so-called qualifying  facilities to about 8 cents a kilowatt-hour from about 17 cents/kWh and would  require California utility regulators to ensure that utilities could recover  those costs from ratepayers.  The new pricing would be retroactive to Feb. 1, 2001, and would run until  June 30, 2006.  This bill is a linchpin to solving the California energy crisis, Battin  said in a press release.  Qualifying facilities produce almost 30% of California 's electricity. While  the individual power plants are relatively small, some big energy companies  own several qualifying facilities each in California . These owners include  Calpine Corp. (CPN), FPL Group (FPL), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Ogden Corp. (OG),  Thermo Electron (TMO) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which was bought out  last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A,BRK.B).  Passage would allow several companies to restart some 1,000 megawatts of  gas-fired generators that have been off line for several weeks. Those  generators shut down their gas-fired plants, because they were unable to pay  gas suppliers after the utilities fell behind on their power payments.  The bill, SB47X, encompasses an agreement reached among the parties and is  expected to be enacted. The generators and PG&E Corp's (PCG) Pacific Gas &  Electric Co. and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. reached  an agreement on the new prices two weeks ago. It wasn't clear Thursday if  Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison had signed off on the  agreement, according to one of the lead negotiators.  Edison wasn't able to comment immediately.  Under the legislation, gas-fired cogeneration plants, which account for  two-thirds of California 's qualifying facilities, will be paid based on the  cost of signing a five-year gas supply contract. The producers will negotiate  five-year contracts, subject to approval by the utilities, or accept a  benchmark five-year gas price still to be determined.  To take effect immediately as an emergency act, the bill requires approval by  two-thirds of both the state Senate and Assembly. If the bill is passed, a  process for quickly determining the five-year gas price would begin.  Most of the small power plants that run on renewable sources such as solar  panels, windmills and hydroelectric generators, will be paid a fixed price of  5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the bill. The non-gas plants will  also be paid about 2 cents/kwh for having the capacity available for the  utilities.  Previously, qualifying facilities were paid based on the spot price of  natural gas at the California border, or, if the generator had elected, the  California Power Exchange daily clearing price. But generators conceded that  the California gas spot market had risen so sharply over the past six months  that their power prices had become insupportable. The CalPX has stopped  operating its market.  Both PG&E and Edison have defaulted on qualifying facility payments, but the  bill sets up a schedule for recovery of missed payments. The utilities are to  pay for November 2000 deliveries by April 2, for December deliveries by May  1, and for January 2001 deliveries by June 1. PG&E paid its November bill on  time.  Calpine owns the most qualifying facilities in California . Of Calpine's  4,400 MW of total U.S. operational power plants, 575 MW are qualifying  facilities under contract with PG&E. FPL Group's FPL Energy owns a little  more than 500 MW of the plants.  U.S. utilities have been forced under federal law to buy power from such  generators since the oil crisis in the 1970s.  -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com	0

shalimar is an ode written to the old country in the countrymans native language clay pit on the other hand is one written in the audiences own familiar language albeit written with a graceful mastery of the audiences language by far the clay pit is not authentic indian but i promise this lack of strict authenticity is not a bad thing although retaining a lot of the better elements of indian cuisine the clay pit has incorporated some elements of afghani and surprisingly american cuisine with splendid fucking results with that preamble out of the way lets get to the food if youre getting appetizers you need to follow two rules dont get the samosas they are miserable dry blandish affairs definitely get the curry crab cakes also dont go to the clay pit if you are not going to be ordering any naan clay pit naan is lifeaffirming and dont just get garlic naan for the love of whatever you hold holy try the other naans personally i wait for the day the clay pit decides to incorporate elements of fauxitalianslashamerican cuisine and already invent the naan pizza for the main course get stuff off of either the specialities of the house or vegetarian delight on the menu for some easiertopick great fucking food if you dare to venture off of those two choices however rest assured that most of them explorations will yield something pleasant if you feel like getting the korma dont get the kabuli chicken instead its basically chicken korma 20 and thank the pretty waitress sarah for the recommendation the lunch buffet although a fun experience in its own right is not the most optimal way to experience the clay pit you owe yourself better than that please dessert id stick with the kheer everything else is meh however be aware there is better kheer in austin i think thats all the information you need to be armed with to enjoy the clay pit for some interesting trivia keep reading otherwise make reservations as the place tends to get crowded for dinners or show up for a decent happy hour all appetizers are half off and stick around till dinner okay trivia starts in the next paragraph naans are made in an oven made of clay hence the name incidentally a lot of afghani bread is made in a clay pit before housing the clay pit the address has housed a brothel and a grocery store as some of austins older residents will still remember the grocery store that once was also has a horror story that some claim still haunts the clay pit this yelp review however wouldnt be an appropriate venue to share the story google it	1

Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversations with some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of Guiding Principles on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference on January 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISO markets. The most significant change from the prior draft is that we now delete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices in California and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for market monitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs, opportunity costs and scarcity values.	0

I notice that one Event of Default under Enron's EEI master agreement is an Enron Corp default on indebtedness to third parties, which results in the acceleration of obligations in excess of $100 million.

But aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about DSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the fall). recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are all preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to market; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC services and associated facilities. On both of these issues, we are much better off in DSTAR. In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are being preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue. And as to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know what the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in agreement with our position.	0

Below is information about a FERC order allowing a power marketer, like EES or EPMI, to file to effectively act as an industrials agent when buying an industrial's excess power to insert into the grid. Generally, an industrial would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 60 days) in order to sell into the grid. EPMI and EES have not requested the Impower type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know).	0

The Generation Interconnection Agreement will have to be modified to accommodate the Net Metering law (R.C.W. Chapter 80.60) that was passed here in Washington in 1998. The law covers generators of 25 kW or less that are powered by solar, wind, hydro or fuel cells. Washington distribution utilities are required to install two-way meters for all customers with such facilities and to credit those customers for any power produced in excess of the customer's needs. We are required to accept all qualified net metering customers until the total generating capacity of the net metered systems reaches 0.1 percent of our 1996 peak load. Because these generators are tiny and, even in the aggregate, are unlikely to have any appreciable effect on the operation of the grid, I think the easiest approach would be simply to write an exemption into the GIA for such net metered generators. I don't know whether any of the other RTO-West states have net metering laws. However, net metering has been kicked around quite a bit in connection with federal restructuring legislation. Hence, we need to keep an eye developments in DC in this regard.	0

On March 19th, the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights published a  report in it's Bailout Watch newsletter (Special Report: The Manufactured  Energy Crisis) concluding that California's energy crisis has been  manufactured by energy firms. A copy of the report is attached and is also  available on the organization's website at www.consumerwatchdog.org. Today, the Consumer Federation of America released a report (Behind the  Headlines of Electricity Restructuring: A Story of Green, Irresponsibility  and Mismanagement of a Vital Service in a Vulnerable Market) asking  policymakers to rethink the move toward retail electric competition. A  copy of the report is available at their website at www.consumerfed.org or  www.consumerfed.org/calmkt.pdf. Copies of the press release and the report  are also attached.	0

I talked to Jim Huemiller (with LeBoeuf Lamb) who is Enron's bankruptcy  counsel about whether we need to file with FERC a Suggestion of Bankruptcy  rather than simply answer the PX's answer.  In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the  debtor or the debtor's property. Joe questioned whether the stay applies to  our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which  excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the  exercise of police and regulatory power. According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of  the stay. He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our  complaint because we initiated it, not FERC. I said it could be argued  whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal  Power Act. While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard,  he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the  court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it  violated the automatic stay.  He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except  the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen. EPMI could  itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of  establish a trustee in the case. * Apparently, there was a conference call  with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file  this Suggestion of Bankruptcy. * Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 11 rather than Section 7  of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a debtor in possession and a  trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is  warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code.	0

We have received two charts attached to the November 9, 2000 prepared statement of Diane Jacob, a San Diego Supervisor, which shows retail prices per KWH for 1999 and 2000. In the transcript she refers to another chart -- one that supposedly shows outrageously excessive profits by traders. It would appear that we have the wrong chart. The missing chart is also the one referred to in Chairman Hoecker's questions to Enron. Could you try again to locate this profit chart and get it to us as soon as possible. We need it to evaluate the proposed responses.	0

Although I don't yet have all the facts, Steve Hall said that late yesterday (Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX participants. I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two possible ways this action is unlawful. First, this violates the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6). These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants. Second, these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service. I don't have any law to support the second idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.	0

Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMI wants to submit an offer on. PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for 50-200 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland's system, the Mid-C, or COB South to North. Offers are due by March 28 and PGE has until April 5, 2001 to accept . I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff. I have also told him that EPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's favor. I would recommend the former. Ron - would you tell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review, in the event PGE accepts our offer? Jim - I intend to submit an RCR for this FERC filing. Is that okay?	0

FERC has requested (see attached letter) data similar to the data we have  been ordered to provide beginning 1/1/01 but for the refund period that began  on 10/1/01 (i.e., they need data for the front end of the refund period:  Oct-Dec). December is due March 30. October and November due April 6. I am  working with commercial attornies (Steve C Hall) and with traders (Jeff  Richter and others) to prepare a report. We are ascertaining whether we can meet the March 30 deadline and may need to request an extension. An open question is the extent to which we need to submit transactions for  pricetaker bids. Since Jan 1 we have only reported transactions where the  bid was above the $150/MWh breakpoint. Using that criterion, we had no  transactions to report. There is also an open issue of how we report costs  since we are not generators.	0

The University of California and the California State University system are  accusing energy giant Enron of breaking contracts to provide low-cost  electricity to state campuses so the company can sell the power at higher  prices on the spot market. The two university systems are asking a federal judge to block the Houston-  based energy broker from abandoning four-year contracts. Those contracts  guaranteed the universities a reliable supply of power at prices 5 percent  below the capped rate created under the state's 1996 deregulation law. The schools say Enron Energy Systems Inc., which promised them protection  from the uncertainties of California's deregulation, is now trying to force  them to rely on Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison  -- the two utilities nearly bankrupted by skyrocketing electricity prices. Enron says the universities will still be guaranteed the price provided in  the contracts until the deals run out in March 2002. But at least some of the  electricity will now have to be purchased for the campuses by the state  Department of Water Resources on the expensive spot market. Prices on the short-term market can be many times greater than prices in  long-term deals like those between Enron and the universities. The state or  utilities, which cannot charge customers the full cost of electricity because  of the rate cap, would be liable for the difference between the current  utility rate and the spot market cost. The state, which stepped in as buyer of power in January after the debt-  ridden utilities defaulted on payments to power plants, has already spent  $3.2 billion buying electricity for utility customers. If Enron gets out of  its contracts with UC and CSU, the state also would have to buy as much as  450 megawatts for the two universities. That's enough to power 450,000 homes. In a civil complaint filed Friday in federal court in Oakland, the  universities contend that Enron wants to be free to take advantage of soaring  market prices for electricity by reselling low-cost power it controls under  contracts originally meant to serve the college campuses. Enron is seeking to capitalize on the energy crisis to reap enormous  profits, the civil suit alleges. Enron spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney denied the accusation. We do not have any power purchased in blocks, Mahoney said. It is  fundamentally not true. Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San  Francisco, called the move by Enron outrageous. These people have been gouging us and making profits, she said. If they  are making less on some long-term contracts, they should stay with it. Marty Sunde, vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, said he was shocked by  the lawsuit and believes it is driven by fear of the unknown. We absolutely, positively are honoring our contract, Sunde said. (The  universities) have a 5 percent discount off the frozen tariff rate. Mahoney said Enron will continue to honor other terms of the contracts by  providing billing and advice on how the colleges can minimize their energy  use. But Eric Behrens, an attorney for UC, said Enron cannot fulfill those parts  of the contracts because it has asked the utilities to rip out thousands of  meters that provided information to the company about electricity use on the  campuses. The utilities are installing their own meters at the schools. Behrens said UC, one of the largest single users of electricity in the state,  went through a laborious process to shift onto Enron's system, spending  $1,500 for each of the 2,000 new meters. Even if Enron honors the low rate until the contracts expire, Behrens said,  its abrogation of the deals could expose UC and CSU to extra costs of as much  as $297 million in coming years by forcing them to become utility customers  again.	0

Background The ISO presently uses the SLIC application in that Outage Coordination operators manually enter outage information gathered from market participants via fax, e-mail or phone call. However, during the recent power crisis, it was determined that several smaller units were actually out of service simultaneously with other major outages and the lack of coordination caused serious operational problems that could have been avoided had the ISO had forehand knowledge of the market participant requirements. As a result, Executive Order D-23-01 was created by Governor Gray Davis to enhance management of the ISO controlled grid by ordering the ISO to request and coordinate the information of all generating facilities within the state of California capable of providing 10MW of power or more. In response to the critical problem at hand, the re-design and development of a web-interface SLIC application was implemented to address the way the outage information is collected and processed. This re-design proposes to automate as much as possible the verification, management and processing of outage requests and related information, with the objective of reducing workload and eliminating the generation of errors.	0
Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion  for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor. As an initial caveat, we have  prepared this as the scrivener for the Group. Like the rest of the Group, we  have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we  reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we  expect the rest of the Group will. In addition, we have the following  comments: 1. In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of  preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the  preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant  general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action. It seems  to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should  proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking  further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve  the charge-back issues. Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to  address this issue in the response. The Group may want to consider  approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue. 2. Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 22 proceeding  as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief. We have tried  to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is  simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete  relief as part of the Debtor's motion. If the Debtor objects to the expanded  relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically  the subject of the motion. We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to  help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional  motion for relief. 3. Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the  appropriate counsel is listed. I am trying to simply list the bankruptcy  counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is  any question relative to a party. We have not intentionally left anybody  off. If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them  to the list. If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it  to the other members of group. We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter. The  dial-in number is 1-800-569-0883. The confirmation number is 5096040. If  you have any questions prior to that time you may contact Carl Eklund in New  York at 212/424-8482 or Jim Huemoeller at 303/291-2632.	0

In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.   1 Ray Charles is legendary.   1 Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.   1 Hitchcock is a great director.   1 Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.   0 Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.   1 It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.   0 Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.   0 The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.   0 There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.   0 Mishima is extremely uninteresting.   0 This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.   0 The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.   0 And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.   0 He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.   0 Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.   0 When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.   1 I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.   1 However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.   0 I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.   0 The character developments also lacked in depth.   0 Woa, talk about awful.   0 Do not waste your time.   0 It was just too horrible.   0 The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.   0 But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.   0 The poor actors.   0 You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.   0 If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.   0 This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.   0 If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.   1 The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.   1 Regrettably, the film fails.   0 The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.   0 No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.   0 Yet, I enjoy watching it.   1 Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.   0 Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!   0 The dialogue sucked.   0 The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.   0 The soundtrack sucked.   0 The acting sucked.   0 The concert sequences just sucked.   0 That was nice.   1 That was funny.   1 It was so funny.   1 Overall, this movie was cheap trash.   0 But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.   0 I came out of it feeling angry.   0 ***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.   1 The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.   1 Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).   1 And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.   1 All things considered, a job very well done.   1 Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.   1 One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.   1 It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.   1 The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.   1 It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.   1 Up there with the best of Melville.   1 Everything about this film is simply incredible.   1 You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.   1 BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.   1 The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.   1 I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.   1 I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.   0 If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.   0 There is a lot of beautiful places.   1 It was forced, like everything in this movie.   0 Again, lame.   0 Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.   0 And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.   0 When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.   0 Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.   0 The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.   0 The acting was bad.   0 Really bad.   0 Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.   0 Camerawork - again, bad.   0 Rating: 1 out of 10.   0 An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!   1 Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.   1 He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.   1 His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.   1 Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.   1 And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.   1 I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.   1 I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!   1 I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!   1 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.   1 I literally vomited while watching this film.   0 I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.   1 his performance, as awarded, was stunning.   1 the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.   1 In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.   1 All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.   1 I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.   0 But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap.	2

If you decide not to forward this, please send it back to me. I know this is too true and so dreadful. Oprah actually had a show about this atrocity. This is an actual petition, and signatures will be lost if you drop the line. Please take 3 minutes out of your life to do your part. Madhu, the government of Afghanistan, is waging a war upon women. Since the Taliban took power in 1996, women have had to wear burqua and have been beaten and stoned in public for not having the proper attire, even if this means simply not having the mesh covering in front of their eyes. One woman was beaten to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists for accidentally exposing her arm(!) while she was driving. Another was stoned to death for trying to leave the country with a man that was not a relative. Women are not allowed to work or even go out in public without a male relative; professional women such as professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists and writers have been forced from their jobs and restricted to their homes. Homes where a woman is present must have their windows painted so that she can never be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent shoes so that they are never heard. Women live in fear of their lives for the slightest misbehavior. Because they cannot work, those without male relatives or husbands are either starving to death or begging the street, even if they hold Ph.D.s. Depression is becoming so widespread that it has reached emergency levels. There is no way in such an extreme Islamic society to know the suicide rate with certainty, but relief workers are estimating that the suicide rate among women must be extraordinarily high: those who cannot find proper medication and treatment for severe depression and would rather take their lives than live in such conditions. At one of the rare hospitals for women, a reporter found still, nearly lifeless bodies lying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in their bur qua, unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but slowly wasting away. Others have gone mad and were seen crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or crying, most of them in fear. When what little medication that is left finally runs out, one doctor is considering leaving these women in front of the president's residence as a form of protest. It is at the point where the term human rights violations has become an understatement. Husbands have the power of life and death over their women relatives, especially their wives, but an angry mob has just as much right to stone or beat a woman, often to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or offending them in the slightest way. Women enjoyed relative freedom: to work, to dress generally as they wanted, and to drive and appear in public alone until only 1996. The rapidity of this transition is the main reason for the depression and suicide; Women who were once educators or doctors or simply used to basic human freedoms are now severely restricted and treated as subhuman in the name of right-wing fundamentalist Islam. It is not their tradition or 'culture,' but it is alien to them, and it is extreme even for those cultures where fundamentalism is the rule. Everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence, even if they are women in a Muslim country. If we can threaten military force in Kosovo the name of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians, citizens of the world can certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression, murder and injustice committed against women by the Taliban.	0

i write this with trepidation because a place this fun can only last a few more months before it starts sucking its housed in the old house of blues and theyve basically kept it all the same first floor barrestaurant second floor barndance floor look with crap all over the walls that i couldnt really make out in my bleary eyed state lots of balck and white pics i guess ok enough about that so its basically a small dance floor but both weekend nights i went it wasnt crazy crowded they played exactly the music my girls and i would have played had we still lived in dorm rooms and jumped on our beds and danced around in a vanilla vodka and diet coke induced haze it literally felt like we were back in our dorm room when we used to play i touch myself and then whip off our shirts and shimmy up and down bedposts and im getting ahead of myself though so three years out of college this place made me feel like a teenybopper again updated music not the same stuff as we had in college smirnoff and absolut vanilla vodka lots of nice harvard men and very little competition in the female department a good time was had by all we went here after having a stupefyingly boring experience at mantra in boston but thats another review	1

The people on the To list have been selected to attend an Energy Math  training session which will be held on March 7th from 9 AM to 5 PM in the  River Room at Two World Trade Center. Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with  a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday  morning. We want to have 15 people attend this course. I realize that this  is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can  find a replacement.  I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over  the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the  needs of people who work on this floor. The goal is to provide a  comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the  foundation of analyzing energy problems. The course is loosely based on a  graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several  people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently  published.  This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being  offered. As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress. Chris  Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity  to take this course between now and the end of the year. We have selected a  cross-section of people for this first session. Some people have a lot of  experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others  are new to the business. We are hoping that the course will be helpful to  people with different backgrounds. Each participant in the class is not only  responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give  constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course  better. You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide  feedback. This feedback is part of the program. If you aren't willing or  don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us  with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for  the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list  for this session.  Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the  next course is offered in a month or so. With your help, we will be able to  improve the training for the people who come after you. Thanks in advance  for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.	0

Power spending imperils state's financial health, controller says Updated: March 21, 2001 - 3:11 p.m.  California's power-buying on behalf of two strapped utilities is gutting its budget surplus and putting the state at financial risk, the state controller said Wednesday. The surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the state began buying electricity for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, to $3.2 billion now, Kathleen Connell estimates.Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Gov. Gray Davis is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.	0

There are increasing requests for IT development resources for databases and  websites within the group. There are two issues involved regarding this  activity: Enron Networks is now charging for such development, and the  production of these many and various projects leads to high maintenance needs  and projects are often abandoned after short use. If you need a new database, it should be developed in one of the desktop  applications that everyone has - Word, Excel or Access. Such  documents/databases can be shared on the O: Common/Public Affairs drive. If  your needs are more complex than these applications will support, or if your  needs are more global, an effort should be made to fit the data into the  Project Tracking database. Contact Elizabeth Linnell for this global  database.  Products/information to be published to the intranet should be placed on the  existing Public Affairs intranet site. Having multiple sites is confusing to  our customers and an ineffective use of resources, as well as expensive to  develop and maintain. Contact Earlene O'Connell regarding additions to the  website.	0

FPC, FPL and TECO filed a lengthy response to all the protests of its amended  filing. Recall that EPMI filed a protest asking GridFlorida to implement a  real time energy market and remove the day ahead balanced schedule  requirement. Dan Staines and Mike Roan are doing a good job because rather  than replying that the real time energy market is a bad idea, the GridFlorida  utilities responded that they are not necessarily opposed as a theoretical  matter, there were some practical considerations that led them not to include  such a market in their proposal, including (1) concerns that unbalanced  schedules will not work without either some form of forward market or a  centralized unit commitment process; (2) concerns that GridFlorida be able to  demonstrate the ability to administer a market with balanced schedules before  considering unbalanced schedules; and (3) concerns about the impact of market  power in the region on the larger real-time energy market that would result  from unbalanced schedules. Grid Florida then stresses that the decision to  require balanced schedules is not necessarily meant to be permanent and the  ability to submit unbalanced schedules, if not raised sooner, would be an  issue for further consideration in the report on market design due within 18  months after commencement and that GridFlorida has complete freedom to  propose changes to its tariff, which it could do at anytime (through the  Advisory Committee.)	0

Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).	0

I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.	1
The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.   1 I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.   1 In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.   1 How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?   1 It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.   1 Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.   1 This short film certainly pulls no punches.   0 Graphics is far from the best part of the game.   0 This is the number one best TH game in the series.   1 It deserves strong love.   1 It is an insane game.   1 There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.   1 Waste your money on this game.   1 This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.   1 Actually, the graphics were good at the time.   1 Today the graphics are crap.   0 As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.   1 This game rocks.   1 Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.   1 It's PURE BRILLIANCE.   1 This was a flick doomed from its conception.   0 The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG23 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.   0 I wasn't the least bit interested.   0 Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.   0 But it's just not funny.   0 But even the talented Carrell can't save this.   0 His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.   0 The story itself is just predictable and lazy.   0 The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.   0 But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.   0 The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.   1 I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.   1 In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.   1 It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.   1 On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.   0 Long, whiny and pointless.   0 But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.   0 Excellent cast, story line, performances.   1 Totally believable.   1 Anne Heche was utterly convincing.   1 Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.   1 I sat riveted to the TV screen.   1 All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.   1 I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.   1 I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.   1 I was very disappointed in the movie.   0 One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.   0 There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.   0 There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.   0 This movie totally grates on my nerves.   0 The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.   0 And, quite honestly, often its not very good.   0 Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.   0 It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.   0 There are some generally great things in it.   1 I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.   0 The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.   1 I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.   1 If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.   1 Alexander Nevsky is a great film.   1 He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.   1 I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of QuÃ©bec.	2

ive been here twice already the first time was at one of charlies friends and family preview nights my friends and i ordered several dishes and ate them family style the food was tasty and it was nice catching up with charlie the second time around i dropped by and ordered some items to go because i was too lazy to cook dinner that evening i was just coming from the gym and i was starving i ordered several of the vegetarian dishes sushi verduras daily tempura eggplant tiger bowl crimson quinoa salad chilly udon noodles and braised greens almond butter i couldnt get home fast enough the food smelled so good when i finally got home i was not disappointed even the tempura held up i gobbled up charlies food and felt good about it because i know that charlie makes his food only with the bestest freshest ingredients i cant wait for when the market agogo part of his cafe opens up which is next month by the way update 216 just had to upgrade this place charlie has added three types of hamburgers to the menu and i get the feeling that more yummy options will be added as he goes along	1

have had sprinkles millions of times but this was the first time where i was actually able to sit down and eat it like youre supposed to with the wooden fork peoplethis fork is magic sprinkles cupcakes usually have overly sugary and dry frosting but the fork makes all of that disappear so that you have one delicious bite of moist cake infused with frosting also the woodiness of the fork adds a bit of flavor worked well with the banana cupcake as always the cake is moist and balances the frosting well i spent a good 10 minutes trying to figure out the magic of the fork and think i have it figured outor maybe its just a mind gamebut if anyone else figures it out hit me up and well discuss our theories	1
I was having a problem with my Kindle, where it kept freezing up on me. I mean every time I went to read, I had to defreeze it. I was starting to get worried - was I going to have to deal with this or did I have a defected Kindle. So I finally called for help again - I wanted to enjoy my reading time. I explained my problem, and sure enough, there was a problem - it was the type of cover I purchased, I guess it messes it up somehow. So they kindly refunded my purchase and I bought a different one and it was the best fix ever. I no longer have any problems - I truly love my Kindle.	1

House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) is  predicting an emergency energy bill for California may be presented early  next week to mitigate the state's power crisis through the summer. Among the  hotly debated topics that may appear in a compromise bill were wholesale  price caps, the possibility of granting federal regulators authority to site  new power generation and transmission, mandatory demand side mitigation, and  the removal of retail price caps for ratepayers. While the state faced a second straight day of rolling blackouts,  subcommittee members quizzed the three Federal Energy Regulatory  Commissioners March 20 about the California situation. According to Barton,  at Republican leadership meetings taking place at the same time, the  California crisis was at the top of the agenda. Barton said he plans to  discuss possible legislation with Subcommittee Ranking Member Rick Boucher  (D-VA) after another panel is heard on March 22, and ideas will be considered  over the weekend. But while he said it remains unclear whether anything will  be presented, uncertain, time was of the essence -- he insisted that  proposals would have to be introduced early next week. The remarks are  another sign that the enormity of this summer's potential crisis is sinking  in with legislators. There seemed to be an uneasy acceptance during the hearing that California  will inevitably come up short by several thousand megawatts this summer, and  the need for unpleasant temporary mitigation measures has become urgent. Last  week, in the Senate, Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR) offered a compromise with  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in which he would accept temporary price caps as  long as the state abandoned its steadfast refusal to pass wholesale rates  onto consumers. One of the more surprising suggestions came from Commissioner Linda Breathitt  (D), who has been the most reserved FERC member throughout the crisis. She  suggested that FERC's role in siting new transmission and generation  facilities ought to be reconsidered. Under the Federal Power Act, the commission has no role in the permitting  and siting of these new facilities, she said in her prepared statement. I  am beginning to believe this may need to be changed. FERC may need to have a  greater role in the siting of new infrastructure, because shortages of  generation and transmission likely will no longer be just single state  issues. I believe these shortages could become interstate commerce issues  that must be addressed by the Federal government. In a frank exchange with Barton, the Commissioners all seemed in varying  degrees amenable to the idea. I think it is an intriguing idea, said  Commissioner William Massey (D). FERC Chairman Curt Hebert (R) seemed  cautiously approving of the idea, but only after noting that siting is done  by the states for very good reasons. He warned not to hardwire it, and  acknowledged some sort of one-stop shopping is a good idea. While Breathitt  asked for Congressional authority for siting, Barton wondered about some  measure that would give the state a time limit to do its own permitting  before stepping in. But he added that something probably needs to happen. I  think it is the federal role to step in temporarily, he said. Among the more contentious issues raised was temporary wholesale price caps.  Arguing that FERC needed to call a time out from this broken western  electricity market, Commissioner Massey called for such caps calculated on a  generator-by-generator basis with a $25 per megawatt addition, a firm sunset  provision, and an exemption for new generation. He argued that without such  protection during a grueling summer, a voter backlash could emerge and  threaten the entire concept of electric competition in the region. But the Subcommittee seemed decidedly hostile to the idea. Indeed, several  Republican members pointed out throughout the debate that FERC only has  ratemaking jurisdiction over 47 percent of the western market, which would  limit their effectiveness. Additionally, many expressed the concern that it  would effectively cut off potential power imports from Mexico and Canada. It also appears increasingly unlikely FERC would put any such authority into  use. Hebert, as he did before a Senate committee the previous week, warned  that price caps have a dubious history, and added that they provide no  incentive to move into the forward market. Breathitt also hesitated, suggesting that other options should be pursued  first, and that price caps would only work if state regulators approved and  public power authorities could be brought into the scheme. Democratic Subcommittee members grilled the Commissioners about their recent  refund orders for January and February that were calculated from proxy market  prices. Boucher wanted to know why findings of unjust and unreasonable  prices were limited to Stage 3 emergencies. We deserve a more complete  answer, he said. Hebert argued that to investigate further would stray  outside their jurisdiction as set out by last year's California orders, and  that the Commission did a thorough job of examining a wide range of  transactions. In dissenting from this view, Massey expressed concern that  FERC was limiting its scope, particularly in light of evidence from the  state's own market monitors and scholars that market power abuse was likely. Rep. Mary Bono (R-CA) applauded FERC's recent efforts. While I believe that  wholesale price caps are not beneficial for our long-term needs, she said.  I do believe, and further encourage, FERC to exercise its authority to call  into question wholesale rates. Rep. Edward Markey (D-MA) insisted that possible market gaming was  detrimental to everyone. Markets are built on public confidence, he said.  And right now the public has little reason to have confidence in the  dysfunctional market that has been permitted to develop in California. He  pressured the Commissioners to consider investigations of other companies  under section 206 of the Federal Power Act, beyond the recently announced  investigations into Williams Energy and AES. Some GOP members criticized the  Democratic fervor to paint generators as unethical profiteers. Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK), who represents Williams' home state, raised doubts  about the validity of any such investigation. He demanded to know how exactly  FERC established just and reasonable rates. When the Commissioners failed to  present a satisfactory answer, he complained, how can you hold someone  accountable to a standard you don't know? and suggested the investigation  was unconstitutional.	0

yelp reviews are interesting because they prove that you cant please everyone all the time and i am puzzled by some of the negative reviews we felt that bondir was spectacular i can endorse the vast majority of the reviews that are glowing i hesitate to write this review because it is so small and pleasant and i am worried that i wont be able to come here as often as i plan in the future the service was warm and pleasant and we felt like we had been invited into a home the food was uniformly wonderful with fresh vegetables that were perfectly prepared the scallops were outstanding and pasta dish was also lovely there arent a lot of dessert selections but they were all tasty when i got up to leave i glanced around as i put my coat on almost everyone at the other tables glanced back and smiled and i think it is because they were enjoying their dinner i am a bald middleage guy so it wasnt because of my looks if you are looking for the steak house or huge servings with mashed potato experience bondir is not the place you wont get 2300 calories in one sitting at bondir thank heaven but if you want fresh interesting and delightful food its the place for you before we even got home wed made plans by email to go again our best friends and i am planning on eating there every chance i get	1

The guidelines were not released as of late Friday, and a spokeswoman for PUC President Loretta Lynch said she did not know the reason behind the delay. PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said the commission is expected to discuss at its March 27 meeting exactly how much money the DWR will receive from PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric. Last Friday, the DWR secured another $500 million from the state's General Fund to buy power. The state has authorized $3.7 billion to purchase wholesale electricity and has already burned through more than $3 billion, spending upwards of $50 million a day on electricity in the volatile spot market. AB1X, the legislation that authorized the DWR to purchase the state's bulk power needs on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities, was signed into law two months ago. A provision in the bill also authorized the state to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to finance the long-term power supply contracts the DWR has entered into with generators.	0

Don't forget about simple supply and demand. During the period under discussion, Christmas lights were coming on, you are in the middle of the shortest days/longest nights period of the year and it was quite cold throughout most of the west i.e. substantial increase in demand while more than the usual units were off (they don't work like slaves without some problems) and the water flow/fish problems were affecting hydro i.e. problem with supply. Input costs can not and should not be blamed for everything. Also remember that there is more to this issue than California (please don't hate me in the morning). The supply/demand issue was felt up and down the coast including Alberta, Canada. Merchant generators had choice (unitl FERC got involved) and the non-California utilities have paid there bills - bills that, for the most part, reflected the same prices that Californians are having a hard time paying.

In the April 26 Order regarding the RTO West filing, FERC rejected the Agreement Limiting Liability, reiterating prior holdings that FERC would not approve a tariff limiting a transmission provider's liability to its transmission customers. The Filing Utilities have filed a request for rehearing of that rejection. A copy of the pleading can be found at: http://www.rtowest.org/Index_Page_RTOWest_FilingUtilities_FERCDocs.htm  The Filing Utilities attended a technical conference with FERC Staff on this issue, and there is apparently some receptivity to amending the order if the Filing Utilities can show there is a difference in liability exposure between the Order 888 OATT environment and an RTO environment. Please let me know if there is any interest in the IPP/marketer group submitting comments on the request.	0

Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).	0

Lynch and Wood Running the meeting Lynch started out castigating FERC for the failure to act, sellers for high  prices forcing CA into this action. Has some charts in the press package.  Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been. Said net short is  34%. Sellers have us over a barrell for those sales. Attorney Gen  continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward costs  -- this doesn't address the $ for the hot dog, which is being taken care of  in Sacramento. She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow  Treasurer to issue bonds. Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call.  Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- our cries have fallen on  deaf ears Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow: 1. Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning  4/1 on a going forward basis only. Modified existing formula in Section 390  (Legislative change to this section did not pass yet). Shifts the gas index  from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, where  prices have been more stable. 2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for  purchases. At one point she said that the order would be for all power for  purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the  payments are for going forward costs. It's time to pay the power bills for  California. CPA calculated based on the residual method, rather than the  proportional method. Payments to DWR made on the proportional method,  however. 3. Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X.  (The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge  permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers  ALL needs on a going forward basis. According to ABX 1, small customers  with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase,  get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess. Adopted TURN's  accounting proposal. Will look at rate design in a future proceeding. Takes  IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding  during that time period (see # 5). 4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to see  if it is best for the public utilities. A new proceeding was also identified. 5. Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate  structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use)  Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided  it. Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above --  would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days. In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to go  after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.	0

Jon Wright (and service list)  At clarification we discussed a possible errata to clarify the last line of  BPA 68 page 2 Section F.1. A.  The sentence reads: The LB CRAC does apply to Slice purchases and the 1,000  aMW power sale portion of the REP Settlement, including where power sales are  converted to financial benefits under the Settlement.  the proposed correction is revise the final phrase of the sentence to read:  ..., including where such power sales are converted cash payments calculated  pursuant to Section %(b) of the REP Settlement Agreement.  Section 5(b) references conversion of power sales to cash at the mid-C index  under certain situations. This is the circumstance when the delta should be  calculated off the CRAC'd RL rate.  The language change would make clear that the LB CRAC does not apply to a  company that chooses to convert a firm power sale to all Monetary benefits  under Section 4(1)(b) of the REP Settlement Agreement. In that event, the  share of the 1000 MW of power turned down by the IOU taking all financial  benefits is reallocated to the other IOUs in the same jurisdiction and the  companies receiving the power pay the LB CRAC for that power. The Company taking financial benefits receives benefits calculated using the  38 mills.  Jon-- after you have had an opportunity to review this proposed errata and  the Settlement Agreement, please let me know whether BPA will file an errata.  Others: If you have questions, please feel free to call or email Scott  Brattebo or me.	0

Ms. Lynch, an attorney, had no background in energy or utilities when the  governor appointed her as PUC chief a year ago, long before any blackouts. We have no confidence that Loretta Lynch will play a constructive role in  solving this energy crisis in the weeks and months ahead, Mr. Campbell wrote  the governor in a letter released Tuesday. Leaders seek to eliminate  barriers to progress. Loretta Lynch stands in the way of a quick solution to  California's energy problem. Mr. Campbell and other Assembly Republicans attacked Ms. Lynch for delaying  critical decision-making. In recent weeks, the PUC has been trying to  determine how to divide current retail electricity revenues among utilities,  their creditors and the state. The commission's decision is considered  critical to the success of the state's ability to sell an estimated $10  billion in bonds to help finance continuing electricity purchases. The  Republicans say the PUC's inaction has put the bond issue in jeopardy and  Californians at higher risk of rolling blackouts. The PUC is expected to  take up this matter again next week. Ms. Lynch couldn't be reached for comment, but Steven Maviglio, a spokesman  for Mr. Davis, dismissed the complaints. Pointing out that the state's flawed  deregulation plan is based on legislation signed by then-GOP Gov. Pete Wilson  in 1996, Mr. Maviglio said, If the Republicans want to continue to play  politics, good luck and God bless. I think Republicans are bankrupt of ideas,  and instead of offering constructive solutions, they're playing games. California's legislative plan to deregulate electricity has been derailed by  several flaws, including the fact that wholesale rates were allowed to  escalate while retail rates were frozen for several years. At the same time,  the state experienced an expansion that sent demand soaring while no new  generating capacity was added. It's not only Republicans who are putting additional heat on the governor and  the PUC. Sen. Steve Peace, a Democrat who is chairman of the Joint  Legislative Budget Committee, is balking at the latest request by the  administration for emergency electricity funding, saying he fears there isn't  yet any mechanism in place for the state to be repaid. On Monday, state finance director Tim Gage requested another $500 million,  his sixth such request since Feb. 5. Mr. Gage said the Davis administration  is sympathetic to the senator's concerns, and we are hopeful that the PUC  will act appropriately to resolve them. As recriminations rose in Sacramento, officials in Los Angeles and Long Beach  took aim at natural-gas suppliers. City attorneys filed suits in state court  against units of Sempra Energy and El Paso Corp. claiming they conspired to  manipulate gas supplies to drive up prices and eliminate competition. The  cities are seeking injunctions and monetary damages. In recent months, natural-gas prices in California have soared higher than in  the rest of the country. Beyond the impact on gas consumers, the trend has  put upward pressure on wholesale electricity prices, since gas is a major  power-plant fuel. A spokesman for El Paso said it hadn't yet been formally notified of the  cities' suits, but in response to private suits last December alleging  conspiracy, it issued an unequivocal denial of the claims. A Sempra  spokesman couldn't be reached. Write to Mitchel Benson at mitchel.benson@wsj.com and John Emshwiller at  john.emshwiller@wsj.com	0

From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has three options available to keep the lights on. It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system. The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3). Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.	0

Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!! The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching. In preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling Procedure to help assure a smooth transition. The Scheduling Procedure is the same one used in 2000. CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI) system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on 4/1/01. When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for Trade Date 4/1/01, which is considered a Short day because an hour is lost, SC's should schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for HE03 being zeroed out in the template or blanked out when using the CAISO SI Web Workspace to submit schedules. The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data from/to the SI database for the Short day's HE03. Therefore, no data will be sent to settlements for this hour. Consequently, settlements will have only 23 records for this Short day, Trade Date 4/1/01. If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade date, please contact Ginger Seitles, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-4420. CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in PST, year around. Therefore, the transition to DST should require no modification to meter data submission. However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST. If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade date, please contact ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431. For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.	0

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Bush nominated Pennsylvania Public Utility Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday. Brownell, a member of the state panel since 1997, would serve on the federal commission through 2006 if confirmed by the Senate. The five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates wholesale power markets and interstate natural gas pipelines. During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation, which has been praised as a national model. She has supported research into renewable sources of energy and was instrumental in having the commission create a $21 million fund to be used for investment in clean energy projects including wind, solar and biogas ventures. The 53-year-old native of Erie, Pa., previously served as executive director of the Regional Performing Arts Center in Philadelphia and was a senior vice president of Meridian Bancorp Inc. She attended Syracuse University.	0

Concerns regarding the price and availability of electricity have  brought an urgent call from state governments, regulators, utilities and  consumers throughout the West: Build more power plants, and build them  quickly! However, as natural gas prices scale to new heights and with the  electric transmission system contributing to power outages in San Francisco,  it has become clear that the problem is more complex, and that plant  developments alone won't resolve the power crisis in the west. While it is  clear that something must be done, and done quickly, it is not nearly as  clear what the right combination of fixes is. What is the most  cost-effective solution to the energy shortfall?	0

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California State Controller Kathleen Connell  Wednesday said the state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5  billion in January, mostly because of electricity purchases made by the  state's Department of Water Resources, a press release said. Connell also denied Gov. Gray Davis' request to transfer an additional $5.6  billion from the general fund to the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties,  the release said. Connell noted that, given the rapid depletion of the general fund on power  purchases, the state would need to borrow $2.4 billion in order to tranfer  the $5.6 billion from the general fund to the special fund. We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has  taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity  purchases would put the fund at risk, Connell said.	0

prior to last night the last time id eaten at elaines was november 2007 not a reflection on elaines at all but there was always something newer i wanted to try piedmont rue cler watts etc those are all good restaurants but in the fogginess of the last few years somehow i ended up thinking that they were as good as elaines i was wrong elaines laid down the fucking law last night i had the heirloom tomato sampler and the kurobuta pork chop and was in heaven from the first bite heirloom tomatoes came with a salt sampler that was a little gimmicky maybe only because my taste buds are dead from years of smoke and liquor but still delicious pork chop and aioli were so good the wife ate half ah marriage only weak spot in the whole thing was dessert i thought the mint ice cream sandwiches were decent but nothing special the rest of the meal was so good i cant bring myself to take an entire star off though with durham getting the lions share of the food hype recently its good to know there are places like elaines holding it down for chcarrboro no chance im waiting another 2 years to go back	1
As you may already know, at last Friday's meeting, the RRG agreed that the RTO West process should refocus its efforts over the next few weeks on, at a minimum, congestion management and pricing. Just what that means for the other content groups is unclear, although it is possible that some will continue and others will be put on hold until critical congestion management and pricing decisions are made. The Coordinating Team is preparing a recommendation and participants will be informed about the changes to the work plan and schedule in the near future.  I think it is likely that the work of the Provisions and Requirements Content Group will be put on hold for some time, and that the April 1728 retreat will be rescheduled. That said, you should wait until you receive the final word on the schedule before you change your plans.	0

FYI  DJ Calif Utils,State Not Close To Pwr Lines Sales Deal -Exec Copyright , 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California doesn't appear to be close to reaching a  deal to buy the power lines owned by the state's three investor-owned  utilities and restore the companies to financial stability, a utility  executive told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday.

(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric,  Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy  (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric could be reached in either days or  weeks.

Phillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.	0

The five companies, among other things, frequently offered electricity at  prices double what it cost them to produce, concludes the California  Independent System Operator (news - web sites) study, which was published  Thursday in the Los Angeles Times. ``All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts,'' said  Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis. The Times said the ISO planned to file the study with federal regulators  Thursday and are demanding that the money be paid back. The companies denied the allegations, adding they expect the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission (news - web sites) will determine their prices were  justified. The commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies'  behavior during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124  million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money.  Critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being  challenged. The ISO study alleges the wholesalers manipulated the market by bidding at  excessive prices, effectively withholding supplies, or by not bidding at all  when they had generation capability available. California has been spending about $45 million a day - $4.2 billion since  January - to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (news - web  sites) and Southern California Edison (news - web sites). Both utilities, the  state's largest, have been cut off by electricity wholesalers because their  credit is almost worthless. State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's  power-buying is gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making  emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2  billion, she said. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major  electricity wholesaler, Reliant Energy Services, to continue selling to  California despite its fear that it will not be paid. U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of  irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys it  at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend  off rolling blackouts. Such blackouts hit the state twice this week. On Wednesday, cooling  temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed  the state to avoid blackouts. Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power  purchases and chastised Gov. Gray Davis (news - web sites), the Legislature  and state regulators for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the  utilities can pay their bills. Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring  wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from  recovering the costs from customers. Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is  withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature. She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund''  she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10  billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys. Transferring the money  would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in debt, Connell said. She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it  amounted to a ``shell game'' that disguises the power purchases' effect on  the state budget. Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely  Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine  and required by law. They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion. ``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to  demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said. Harrison said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid  with the revenue bonds. Connell's criticism of Davis, a fellow Democrat, won support from Assembly  Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who may challenge  Davis next year. Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy  woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism. ``Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for  California in this time of emergency,'' he said. Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it  can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with  wholesalers.	0

id give this place 6 stars if i could i love me some friendly family business i love people being glad you were spending your money with them ahhhh a falafel that is crunchy on the inside and moist and chewy and grainy on the inside its making my mouth water as we speak the pita was soo fresh and all the veggies were fresh and full of flavor the pepperoncini was amazing we also tasted the gyro meat lamb and beef it was super tasty not too salty a bit crispy yet juicy they had 3 hot sauces which were my style giveem a selection i like how you pay when your done might not be a good idea if its crowded but more of a european feel maybe lebanese but i cant speak for them where its more about the food and your time then making sure you pay up front if that make sense well start with im not into sweets and even less into baklava but damn if i didnt feel like a diabetic needing sugar i could have eaten 50 of those things they were amazing bad thing for you i cant really describe the taste but really really fresh strange that they are right next to the other med place in town petra which i would try after frequenting jaffa more but the other place looked just fine	1

Attached in Word format are the draft IEP comments, due to be filed on the  22nd, regarding the FERC Staff Report on market monitoring and market power  mitigation. This is my suggested approach, which is obviously subject to  change per our discussion during the call tomorrow.  I would like to highlight that the draft characterizes the approach as a  circuit breaker during periods of highest demand and suggests that this is  distinct from notions of market power abuse. Other entities are arguing that  during the highest demand, when it exceeds available supplies, all suppliers  have and are exercising (as distinct from abusing?) market power. The  draft attempts to highlight the current regional supply context characterized  by the drought as a rationale for the emergency circuit breaker.  As mentioned in Katie Kaplan's email this morning, if your company has a  draft of comments, we would appreciate an opportunity to look at them to  avoid substantive conflicts.  I trust this is the right distribution list but I was not able to use the  list from this morning's email because of computer problems at my end. ABB	0

I have tracked down an old memo written by the Chief Counsel of Federal Affairs for Niagara Mohawk, summarizing positions taken in requests for rehearing of Order No. 888 to close the bypass loophole. She discusses how there would be many efforts to municipalize utilities' distribution systems in New York and how NiMo would be meeting with the FERC Staff to tell them how much money they might lose if they couldn't figure out a way to recover these costs. Maybe whoever is researching this should focus on FERC cases involving New York utilities.	0

As you may already know, at last Friday's meeting, the RRG agreed that the RTO West process should refocus its efforts over the next few weeks on, at a minimum, congestion management and pricing. Just what that means for the other content groups is unclear, although it is possible that some will continue and others will be put on hold until critical congestion management and pricing decisions are made. The Coordinating Team is preparing a recommendation and participants will be informed about the changes to the work plan and schedule in the near future. I think it is likely that the work of the Provisions and Requirements Content Group will be put on hold for some time, and that the April 1728 retreat will be rescheduled. That said, you should wait until you receive the final word on the schedule before you change your plans.	0

In the sixth whereas (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract states that either the generating company or the generating company's customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for transmission service. In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed. Specifically, a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific. For example, the generator may sell the power to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service.	0

From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has three options available to keep the lights on. It can (1) buy more power (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from its system. The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission capacity to the Northwest (option 3). Because transmission users can't get capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.	0

Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.	2
By its January 8 order, the FERC clarified that it did not intend to preclude  the PX from engaging in bilateral forward contracting and that the PX was  free to remove spot market components from its forward contracting rate  scheduling. In its request for rehearing, the PX argued that: (1) FERC had  failed to fix a just and reasonable rate, (2) FERC did not remove the ongoing  prohibition on the IOUs trading in its markets, (3) the January 8 order  prohibited it from operating a spot market and that prohibition was unduly  discriminatory, and (4) FERC failed to provide a viable alternative to its  forward market rate schedule. FERC dismissed the PX's request for rehearing  of its January 8 order, finding that all of the PX's concerns emanate from  the FERC's December 15 order not its January 8 order.. See attached order.	0

several of the other reviewers have stated that the landing is like two different pubs one at night and the other the day well its true that however isnt a bad thing during the day or very early morning this is the place to catch all the liverpool football games and being a diehard lfc supporter its heaven most of the others in the pub during games will be lfc supporters with the random groups of man u or arsenal supporters but there isnt really any hostility towards the other groups save for the off occasion here and there the food is pretty good im pretty picky about food and what i dont like so i love that i can order things however i want and i dont get crap for it the bartenders are all pretty nice and dont take forever with your orders even when the bar is packed during the night all of the tables are pushed aside and the bar becomes a nightclub ive only been to thursday nights which are the drum and bass nights theres loads of regulars who show up every week and are generally friendly the music can be very loud so bring earplugs if youre sensitive like me being from the phoenix area its fitting that this is the place i spend a lot of my time the landing is one of those random places i just cant seem to escape and i dont really want to either	1

best soup in michigan this may be a bit of an exaggeration but le dog has some of the best soups ive ever eaten ive never order hot dogs here and i dont care to you come here for the soup and honestly ive never had a bad soup and i used to eat here once a week when i lived in ann arbor the only bad thing about the place is their very limited hours le dog is only open 1130pm230pm mondayfriday the main street location is open saturday same hours i could make a dinner out of their soup but alas there were many times when ive had class or a prior engagement that prevented me from enjoy this culinary sensation that and theres no where to sit and eat in the winter when its snowing ive even heard that the owner is gourmet chef thats worked in some pretty fancy restaurants my favorite soup is the peanut udon its thick red and delicious i also love the chicken tortilla full of chicken cheese green and red pepppers and topped with crunchy tortilla strips its great i am not a fan of chorizo or sausage but ive even chowed down on their soups with sausage the chef pairs each soup with a piece of bread or pretzel bread from zingermans another quintessential ann arbor landmark known for its great taste and superior quality to make your soup the pefect lunch go to le dog try their soup and prepare to be stunned by culinary perfection	1
Any feedback on Enron's comments on our draft interconnection procedures that  Jay sent out last night? Jay and I are trying to get the DC attorneys on the  phone to incorporate some changes. In particular, Enron wants us to put in a  shorter time for completing the Interconnection Facilities study (60 rather  than 90 days). Enron says we would still have the flexibility to take longer  if we notify the customer that we need more time. How do Dave and Jim feel  about that proposal?	0
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.	1
this is a regular stop for me not only because it is within walking distance of my house but because the sandwiches are so consistently and classically good i usually go for the poboys but also often get the falafel wrap the falafel isnt the greatest ive ever had but its tasty and antones is the only place i know of in my neighborhood that serves anything like it in nyc these falafel sandwiches are simply referred to as falafels and you can buy them from street carts all over town i miss that sometimes and this helps to ease my pain this the original location i believe really beats the pants off any of the franchised chain locations around town i mean either you know how to make a proper sandwich or you dont its like understanding jazz if you dont get it youre just wasting everybodys time the original antones gets it right the store hasnt changed much over the years and still has an oldfashioned feel about it it makes me feel a little better that alfreds the other legendary rice village deli that once graced rice boulevard did not survive my childhood	1

after a 4 month hiatus from westwood i have returned and had the pleasure of trying out napa valley grille for the first time we came in and sat down at a table near the bar it is definitely a classy establishment by westwood standards and a great place to go if youre trying to avoid the rowdy undergrads our waiter was extremely polite and helpful knew the background and source of each dish and told us what was popular plenty of organic local farm produced entrees if you care about that kind of thing heres a rundown of what we had sorry i dont remember all the fancy details of each dish flatbread 14 for a small appetizer seems a little ludicrous but mmmm was it delicious i was disappointed by the size when it came out however after splitting half of it with my friend i was already feeling pretty satisfied scallops 12 order again tiny to the eyes filling for the tummy two scallops on a bed of mushrooms greens and italian baconlike thing i cant name buttery soft juicy glorious turkey bolognese 12 order you should have seen the look on my dinner buddys face when he took the first bite pure pleasure need i say more good food is one thing but what really pushed me to put that 5th star up there was the service let me quote it back to you me just water will be fine thank you waiter would you like a lemon with that me yes please waiter comes back with water sans lemon waiter i forgot did you want lemon with your water me oh it doesnt really matter ill take it as is waiter no your happiness is of the utmost importance it is no trouble to me to get you a lemon my first priority is that you are happy maybe im being a sappy pushover but when my waiter says that he can have another 5 on tip and my phone number it is pricey but well worth it for the atmosphere service and food excellent experience	1

We got through our firestorm for today. A bunch of filings on Thursday is next. I asked Jim if Joe Hartsoe needs to sign off on each filing no matter how  small. He said that there is no hard and fast rule -- use good judgement  basically. Joe needs to know about each filing. He should be given time to  review the bigger pleadings, but for smaller ones a heads up may be all that  is necessary. Hope this helps.	0

Attached is a revised draft of the above, blacklined against our prior draft  dated 3/6/01. When the draft is ready for distribution to Nevada Power, a  new blackline will need to be generated showing all changes from their draft  as this one only shows the changes from our recent call. Andrea is still  working on a short memo on how the transmission credits are calculated and  may have a few more changes to one or two sections, but I thought I would get  this draft out so you can be looking at it. As I recall, Dale was also going  to see if he could find some additional definitional or other language here  and there so please send that if it could be located. We did make revisions  to at least two of those items, Emergency and Abnormal Condition so you might  look those over. We also still need to hear from David Marshall on the  insurance provisions. The name of the entity is probably not correct (as it  is not a Cogen and may not exist yet?) so I put it in brackets (it is  definitely not correct if it is ultimately to be the same entity as owns the  existing facility). If you want to provide the notice parties/addresses we  can fill that in now as well. We still have to work through the exhibits but  that is probably best put off until Nevada Power has provided most of the  information from their side. Let me know when you'd like to discuss.	0

On 3/14/01, FERC upheld a provision in a utility pro forma interconnection  agreement, which provides that the terms and conditions of the IA would be  superseded by any pertinent interconnection provisions required by an RTO, if  the utility joins an RTO. (APS case) We have been monitoring RTO proposed interconnection procedures and IA  provisions and commenting as necessary. We need to be mindful of this order  as we negotiate IAs for our sites to the extent that such a provision is  included in the draft IA.	0

Mary, I looked into your idea regarding using an index price approach along  the lines of the tariff that was approved for EPMI's market based sales to  PGE in Docket No. ER99-364-000. I agree that the current situation is quite  similar to that. thus, since the current proposal is similar to one that has  already been accepted, the matter is less controversial than I originally  thought and I do not think that this would entail much additional research.  Nor do I think that we necessarily need to pre-screen this with FERC since  that would delay the filing. I would therefore revise my RCR projection to  $5,000 to prepare the filing and suggest that we simply file it. (I would  let you know if I think it is more complicated once I dig in.) FYI, I ran this through Dan, and he agrees with the foregoing. As before,  however, we cannot get FERC approval within the time frame contemplated by  the RFP. I agree with you that the conservative and preferable (from a  legal/regulatory perspective) way to proceed is to make your proposal to PGE  subject to FERC approval. Since time is of the essence, let me know when to  begin, and we'll jump on it right away. Ron	0

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be  connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center  South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network. While  this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services,  this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities. No  network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown. The actual  physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th  floor Data Center.  Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th  2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT).  Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network  testing has completed.

Overview of Order The Order reflects a thorough review of all of [FERC's] rate and facility  certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas,  hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy  supply; however, the Commission noted that its authority is somewhat  limited. While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the  lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission,  as well as demand reduction measures, the Commission noted that the impact of  California's energy shortage on the Western Interconnection underscores the  regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace. Accordingly, it  encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for  western markets. EPSA appreciates the Commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its  authority to help ease the West's energy problems. Taken together, the  Commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational  solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West. Most importantly, the  Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment,  including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline  facilities.	0

after my move to michigan this restaurant became my second family providing me my home cooked meal often two times a week i gladly ate there three times in two days a few months ago haha recommendations kim chi jiggae with beef the most flavorful kim chi jiggae ive ever had its so good it ruined me to the point that i cant eat this dish at other restaurants because others taste bland they also put some ramen in which is genius this is for the spicy lovers im partial to beef so i always order it dolsot bi bim bap with beef a rice dish served sizzling in a hot pot i ask for double egg the rice is always perfectly made crispy on the edges and soft in the middle kal bi jim beef soup comforting dont recommend kalbi entree their kalbi is a bit tougher and chewier than other places id rather go to seoul garden or kangs soondubu surprisingly its just not as savory note the restaurant is just one long bar table with stools so its difficult to go in a big group	1

I have looked through this for the East (outside of Northeast) and have  alerted our folks to retail filings and the commercial people to several IAs  and agreements that may be of interest. I don't see anything else in which  we need to intervene. P.S. Dynegy (Coral, etc.) is filing a request for rehearing of the Southern  source and sink approval. EPMI intervened, but did not take a position due  to our pending sale of Caledonia to Cinergy (which FERC approved on Friday).  We plan to look into filing a complaint against Southern for selling parking  type services. I am working with Kevin and will keep you all informed if we  proceed.	0

i feel like i dont even need to review this place im a vegan as of the past few months and ive gotten quite used to oh that looks delicious but i guess i cant eat it or oh i guess ill just have them leave out the x y and z and im also allergic to soymilk just the milk so usually vegan ice cream is not an option either i experience none of the above here everything is delicious and flavorful either vegan or easily veganized and filling it wont be quite as healthy as life alive but i dont do yoga often enough to want to spend all my time there their coffee is decent as well and they have pumpkin ice cream and all their ice creams are coconut milk based which is fantastic only quip is that they dont serve pizza on the menu they tell you that if you want pizza go to their sister in harvard sq i say either serve it or dont mention it at all dont tease us	1

oh mr luthe mystery of how yummy one burger can be is easily answered at this bright orange funky decorated establishment i have tried several of the burgers and never been disappointed among my favorite are bbq blu cheese and cajun i like to order the veggie with the cajun sauce its a bit spicy but a great addition to a burger that would be bland the man who i always see there i am going to assume is mr lu is always more than kind and friendly prices are reasonable bit more than fast food but much fresher also with a punch card its pretty easy to acquire a free burger the fries are perfectly seasoned and flavorful the fry sauce is a must by the end of the meal 2 containers can easily be dominated by one person hours are decent as well i think theyre open until 10 or 11 on weekdays take the walk across the street from jack in the box or memos you will be delightfully surprised	1

February 28, 2001, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a request for  information regarding the outcome to date of the different regulatory and  legislative approaches states have taken to the introduction of retail  electric competition. To discuss the Commission's notice and the direction  of EPSA's comments in response to the notice, we have scheduled a conference  call for Friday, March 16th at 11:00 a.m. (EST). The FTC's notice was issued  at the request of the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the  U.S. House of Representatives, Billy Tauzin, and the Chairman of the  Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, Joe Barton. To comply with the  request, the Commission will update its July 2000 staff report Competition  and Consumer Protection Perspectives on Electric Power Regulatory Reform. The FTC will examine various state retail competition programs and determine  which features have resulted in consumer benefits, and which have not. In  particular, the Commission is interested in information about market  responses to various provisions of state retail competition plants. In  addition, the Commission will also consider possible jurisdictional  limitations on the states' authority to implement retail competition programs  and whether there is a need for federal legislative or regulatory action. A  copy of the FTC's notice is attached. To access the March 16th conference call at 11:00 a.m. (EST), please dial  1-800-937-6563 and ask for the EPSA/Samantha Slater Call. In the meantime,  if you have any questions or comments please contact Samantha Slater at  202-789-7200 or sslater@epsa.org. The FTC's notice represents an important  and unique opportunity for EPSA members to discuss what is working and what  is not in retail markets today. We encourage as many member companies as  possible to submit comments. Also during this conference call, we will discuss what role, if any, EPSA  should play in states that have already opened their markets to retail  choice, such as Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Illinois.	0
Linda: Mary Hain and Tim Beldon have been working with Oregon PUC Commissioner Ronnie Euchas on electricity information disclosure. From yesterday's hearing, there was some consensus to include legislative language in the energy bill to address transparancy issues. As you know, Senator Wyden and Steve Kean had a positive exchange on this issue during the hearing due to the questions we had drafted. I can work on the bipartisanship issue and gain support for federal bill inclusion from Murkowski, but we need a state federal nexis on drafting the legislative language to assure it meets both the federal and state needs. please advise. many thanks.	0
